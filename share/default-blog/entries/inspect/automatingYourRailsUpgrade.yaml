  If you're going to be upgrading from Rails 0.8.5 to 0.9.0, you should read the
  last page of the "Upgrade Guide":http://rails.hieraki.org/read/book/3 first. 
  The "last page":http://rails.hieraki.org/read/chapter/29 talks about using a
  script to automate the conversion.  I was doing the manual conversion described
  in the first three pages before I realized that I should have tried the script
  first.  Still, read the whole thing.


  The new "Rails Bookshelf":http://rails.hieraki.org/shelf/ looks very promising.
  The two books which cover Rails 0.9.0 are perfect.  The Bookshelf will house the
  "How to Make a Todo List Program with
  Rails":http://darkhost.mine.nu:81/~vince/rails/tutorial.html  tutorial, which I
  found to be a very pragmatic and succinct introduction.
