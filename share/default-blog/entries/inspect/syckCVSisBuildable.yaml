  Allo, friends.  Great news.  The new "Syck":http://rubyforge.org/projects/syck/
  is buildable.  Yes, it has some problems.  The emitter in particular is really,
  really unstable.  Still, it represents several months worth of work rethinking
  and redesigning parts of the extension.


  Here's what you can look forward to:


  * Huge speed improvements when outputting YAML.

  * Automatic use of YAML shortcuts, better looking output.

  * Simplified custom types.  You basically just add @tag_as
  "tag:example.com,2005:myWikiPage"@ to your class definition.  YAML will then
  load and dump the class using the type.

  * Hooks for loading YAML into custom types.  Add @yaml_new@ and
  @yaml_initialize@ methods to your class if you want to override the default
  behavior.

  * Unit tests in C for the core.  This is a huge help, since I'm able to track
  down memory leaks and segfaults much easier.


  Again, this extension is _really unstable_.  If you're going to use it, install
  it into a temporary directory using @ruby install.rb config --prefix=$HOME@. 
  Then, in @irb@, use @$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path( "~/lib" )@ before
  @require 'yaml'@.


  If you want to help debug, come join
  "Yaml-Core":http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/yaml-core.  It's the
  homebase.
