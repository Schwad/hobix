  When asked about the future of Unicode in Ruby 1.9/2.0, Matz replied to
  Ruby-Core with the following laundry list of features he expects in Ruby's
  multibyte character support:


  * characters are represented by single character strings.

  * so that @"abc"[0]@ returns @"a"@ instead of fixnum 97.  

  * all string methods are aware of multibyte characters.

  * new method @String#encoding@ gives character encoding name (e.g. @"utf-8"@).

  * new method @IO#encoding@ gives character encoding name for reading data.

  * new method @IO#encoding=@ sets the character encoding for reading data.


  A library which emulates this could be built, based on Ruby's current @iconv@
  lib. Anybody want to take a stab at it?
