  Jason Hoffman of the red-friendly server farm TextDrive, has a thorough
  expository of one Apache-alternative in his "Should I Consider
  Lighttpd?":http://textdrive.com/weblog/article/25/should-i-consider-lighttpd 
  Leveraging his experience with Rails hosting, he weighs the feature set of
  lighttpd against his essentials for a Rails application.


  bq. I think the best analogy for lighttpd to Those Who Rail Against the Machine
  would "Webrick that does FastCGI": a single lighttpd instance is easy to
  compile, configure and get running for a single Rails App (it took me less than
  10 minutes to have "Manuals":http://manuals.textdrive.com/ running under
  lighttpd).


  It's especially promising that the "lighttpd site":http://lighttpd.net/ itself
  has Ruby and Rails running! (See the right-hand column.)


  The most exhaustive setup instructions can be found on this "Rails on
  Debian":http://old.bougyman.com/RailsonDebian.html howto.  I'm just going to
  offer a few setup pointers on FreeBSD, assuming you have a Rails setup already.


  <pre>
   cd /usr/ports/www/ruby-fcgi
   make install
   cd /usr/ports/www/lighttpd
   make install

   # Add: lighttpd_enable="YES"
   vim /etc/rc.conf

   cd /usr/local/etc
   cp lighttpd.conf.sample lighttpd.conf

   # Follow step '6c' in the Rails on Debian tutorial
   vim lighttpd.conf

   /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lighttpd.sh start
  </pre>


  I love that it comes with some many Apache-a-likes.  For example, @mod_rewrite@.


  You know what would be cool?  Ruby configuration.  Complete Ruby configuration.


  <div class="update">


  *Update:* Ensure you are running lighttpd-1.3.8 or higher, since the lighttpd's
  support for spawning FastCGI processes was buggy or non-existent previous to
  that release.
