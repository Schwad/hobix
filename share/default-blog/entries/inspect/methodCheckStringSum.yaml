  @String#sum( n = 16 )@ computes an n-bit checksum for a string.  This amounts to
  addition of the character codes for a string.  Proof: @?R + ?H == "RH".sum@.


  However, this isn't much of a checksum considering that: @?S + ?G == "RH".sum@. 
  The clash between checksums is large.


  A slightly better checksum is @Object#hash@, a method attached to every Ruby
  object. Since @Object#hash@ uses a multiplier and bit shifter, its clash is
  diminished.  While it is less predictable than @String#sum@, the hash from
  @Object#hash@ can still be easily reversed, so don't expect security from this
  hash.


  As it stands, @String#sum@ works for character math and @Object#hash@ works for
  simplifying storage of Hash keys.


  p(update). *Note:* Method Check is a column which investigates usage of a single
  method available in Ruby or a Ruby library.  Ri conventions are used.  The
  octothorpe symbol @#@ is used to identify *instance* methods (such as
  Object#object_id), while the double-colon @::@ is used for *class* methods (such
  as Object::new.)
