  bq. It would seem that the "Category" in Objective-C is near a selector
  namespace that I worried about since before.

  Though I can understand the basic concept of selector namespace, I have not been
  imagined the concrete behavior(and implementation). It is welcome that there is
  something to refer.



  bq. However, I have not understood the specification well in as far as I search
  by google. Is there a specific example for a concrete behavior and
  implementation?



  bq. Uh-oh, wait.



  bq. Anew I read the page I googled, it's not said that the enable range is
  static scope. If so, is Category a "Mix-in that cannot be added a instance
  variable"? It is regrettable when that.



  bq. Though there are languages that have selector namespace, for example
  Smallscript(S#) and JavaScript(ECMAScript 4.0), I have not understood them as of
  now.



  bq. I welcome the information.
