  I recently got my hands on a copy of Hal Fulton's _The Ruby Way_, published in
  2002 by Sams Publishing.  It's huge.  I would not have the stamina to write
  something like this.  Biblical in proportions.


  Your assignment is pages 46-64, which encompasses the Ruby gotchas section. 
  Parser wierdness, syntax subtleties, handy tricks.  It's an eighteen-page
  bulleted list.


  Here's a link chain to get you into the book on print.google.com:


  # Search for "ruby way":http://www.google.com/search?q=ruby%20way on Google.

  # Under *Book Results*, click the "ruby way" link. (600 pages by Hal Fulton, Guy
  Hurst.)

  # You should be seeing a scan of page 10.  Click on "More results from this
  book."

  # Check it out, every page of the book.  Go to page 4 of the search results. 
  Page 46 should be the first result.


  I wanted to write a script to calculate the URL for you, but a solution was
  evading me.  Perhaps someone else can give it a go?
