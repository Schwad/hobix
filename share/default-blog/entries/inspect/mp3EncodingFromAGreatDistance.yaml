  Okay, focus.  We're lookin for more real-world tutorials, 
  "remember?":http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/podcastingUtilsAndHomeRubyists.html#comments


  How about "a distributed MP3 encoder":http://dark.fhtr.org/pt1_dist_lame.txt
  which pipes data through DRb to a list of clients empowered with LAME?  Needs
  more filler text and hand-holding, but the code is certainly adequate.


  See this is it: someone could read this tutorial, learn Ruby, and then proceed
  to actually *use the script they've just written*.

  *Update:* four parts have been finished and this tutorial is now mirrored at
  "RubyGarden":http://rubygarden.com/ruby?DistributedPipes.  (In case you find
  this entry in the future: Hi, future.)
