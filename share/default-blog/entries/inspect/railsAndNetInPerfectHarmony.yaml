  Now is a time for healing.  See, with Ruby storming onto the scene in so many
  venues of discussion, it's now time to survey the wreckage -- to look back at
  the big octagonal gash we left in the sheet rock, at the array of pipe-smoking
  scholars whose top hats we've knocked asunder, and, yes, at the bittersweet
  scent of lifelong friendships we've effortlessly discarded.


  Take .Net.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and say .Net is fine.  That, aside from
  deep doctrinal friction I feel in its presence, it's actually a very nice set of
  tools.  ASP.Net, in particular, was a great bounding forward.  I wouldn't give
  it all my love, but I might award it a refurbished spelling bee trophy.


  Paul Nicholls is working with "Rails on
  IIS":http://bitmask.co.uk/notes/PermaLink.aspx?guid=66734a57-13db-43c8-887c-457ca87858ac.
  And, personally, the coolest part is the "URL rewriting
  module":http://bitmask.co.uk/notes/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b982c2cf-18de-4eb3-998b-44f00350b749
  he's assembling with the open source Dev-C++ IDE.  It's not mod_rewrite, just a
  simple tokenizer tailored for Rails specifically.


  Anyway, peering down the road a few months, I'm envisioning an angle on the
  "One-Click Server Installer":/ruby-talk/123845 with a wee checkbox for IIS.
