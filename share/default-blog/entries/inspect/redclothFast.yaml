  Alexey Verkhovsky, the new foreman on "Instiki":http://instiki.org/ is helping
  pushing me from behind to get RedCloth 3.0 stable.  (The latest release is
  within hairs!!)  And he's reporting a speed increase I didn't expect, since
  RedCloth handles two kinds of markup now.

  in the import, so RedCloth portion itself must be more than 2 times faster.


  My truest thanks, "Alexey":http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlexeyVerkhovsky!
