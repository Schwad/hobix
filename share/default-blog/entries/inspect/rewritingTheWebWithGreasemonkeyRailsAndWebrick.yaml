  Here's a bountiful wellspring of hot chowdery ideas.  Simon Willison is using a
  local web server (Ruby's own WEBrick and Rails) and some JavaScript to "annotate
  the web":http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2005/03/30/lightweight and share his
  additions as a feed.  Now think about how this could be used to hack the web at
  will:


  bq. This architecture could be easily adapted to add private bookmarks to
  del.icio.us - or to add any number of cool features to any number of other
  sites. Here's another example: Google's Desktop Search integrates results from
  your local drive with the search results page on Google. Using greasemonkey and
  a local web server tied in to OS X Tiger's Spotlight indexer, you could add this
  functionality to any search site you wanted to. Just be sure to lock down the
  web server to only serve requests from localhost, to avoid sharing search
  results for your data with anyone on the network who can see your machine.


  Lots of great GreaseMonkey scripts over on "the
  wiki":http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts.  I wonder if I can use
  this stuff to get comments (optionally) showing up in the RSS feed.
