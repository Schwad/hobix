  And they are neat.  It's just one of those really simple changes to Ruby that
  walks the tightrope between being a very elegant addition and being not worth
  anyone's time ever.


  Supposedly unleashed at last RubyConf by the sublime and blemish-free Rich
  Kilmer, numeric suffixes took the form of methods to @Fixnum@.  Stuff like
  @12.hours@, which returns the number of seconds in a twelve hour period,
  availing you of having to use the unseemly @12 * 60 * 60@.  You can find this
  syntax in the new "Rails 
  0.9.4":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/01/17/rails-094-caching-filters-sqlite3/.


  If you like this idea, then you'll probably dig flgr's patch to Ruby, supplied a
  few weeks ago on Ruby-Core, which adds numeric literal suffixes to Ruby.  His
  "patch":http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/4027 adds
  @f@ and @b@ suffixes to Ruby's number parser.


  <pre>
   >> 5.1b
   => #<BigDecimal:812a76c,'0.51E1',8(8)>
   >> 1f
   => 1.0
  </pre>


  The "ensuing
  thread":http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/vframe.rb/ruby/ruby-core/4027?3944-4245
  isn't acknowledged by Matz, but a few ideas are kicked around for adding @45min@
  or @"10:00"pm@ or similiar suffixes which could make for a very friendly flavor
  of Ruby.

  *Correction:* The patch was fathered by Peter Vanbroekhoven.  I repeat. Peter
  Vanbroekhoven.  Well done.  Peter Vanbroekhoven.
