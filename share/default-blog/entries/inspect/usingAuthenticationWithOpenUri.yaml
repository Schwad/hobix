  Obviously big fans of @open-uri@ around here. And development of @open-uri@ has
  continued with the addition of HTTP Basic authentication, newly implemented in
  both @HEAD@ and @ruby_1_8@ branches of CVS.


  <pre>
    open("http://...", :http_basic_authentication=>[user, password])
  </pre>


  I should note that this was implemented at the behest of Kent Sibilev.  So, hey,
  does anyone else have @open-uri@ wishes?  (And please don't say HTTPS. 
  Tanaka-san has a preliminary patch
  "here":http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/04365 and,
  believe me, that dog is running.)


  <div class="update">


  Within hours, HTTPS support is checked in.  Just like that.  Faster than a
  beaver tale.
