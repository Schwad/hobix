  An old one, but worth repeating if you've yet to understand continuations:


  bq. Say you're in the kitchen in front of the refrigerator, thinking about a
  sandwitch.  You take a continuation right there and stick it in your pocket. 
  Then you get some turkey and bread out of the refrigerator and make yourself a
  sandwitch, which is now sitting on the counter.  You invoke the continuation in
  your pocket, and you find yourself standing in front of the refrigerator again,
  thinking about a sandwitch.  But fortunately, there's a sandwitch on the
  counter, and all the materials used to make it are gone.  So you eat it. :-)


  bq. A continuation doesn't save data.  It's just a closure that closes over the
  execution stack (and any lexicals associated with it; thus the "I want a
  sandwitch" thought).  If things change between the taking and invoking of the
  continuation, those things remain changed after invoking.
