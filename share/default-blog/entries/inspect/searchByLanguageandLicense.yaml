  Can't remember where I saw this.  "Koders":http://koders.com/ is a search engine
  which indexes source code and arranges it by project.  It's come in handy a few
  times this week:


  # When searching for API functions:
  "StringValue":http://koders.com/?s=StringValue+ruby,
  "STR2CSTR":http://koders.com/?s=STR2CSTR,
  "rb_ary_new4":http://koders.com/?s=rb_ary_new4, you get the picture.

  # Extensions to Ruby builtins:
  "String":http://koders.com/?s=%22class+String%22&_%3Ala=Ruby,
  "Array":http://koders.com/?s=%22class+Array%22&_%3Ala=Ruby,
  "Hash":http://koders.com/?s=%22class+Hash%22&_%3Ala=Ruby.

  # Once you find a source file, you can click on the name of its project (listed
  under its citation) and get a nice "project
  browser":http://koders.com/info.aspx?c=ProjectInfo&pid=JDfMrUoVY2mI9SMq6Ni82A__.
  Estimated cost of Vim development: <b>$2,398,200</b>.


  It only seems to search Savannah, Sourceforge, the major repositories.  So, if
  you're on Rubyforge, just submit your project
  "here":http://koders.com/info.aspx?c=forms/SubmitProject.
