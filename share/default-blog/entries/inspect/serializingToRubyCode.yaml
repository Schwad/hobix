  Amid a discussion on the list about XML v. YAML (_hope they declare a winner!_),
  I noticed a message by Dick Davies about keeping his data in Ruby code rather
  than any other data formats.  And then I remembered AMarshal.  And then I
  remembered that it's not in the Ruby stdlib. 


  "AMarshal":http://cvs.m17n.org/~akr/amarshal/ is a solid extension for saving
  your objects as straight Ruby.  Readable, fast and stable.  NaHi's tested the
  slime outta this extension.  And, well, knowing Tanaka Akira's consummate
  debugging... I don't want to bloat the Ruby dist too much more, but this is a
  great extension.


  <pre>
   >> require 'amarshal-pretty'
   => true
   >> puts AMarshal.dump_pretty(
   ?>   {'name' => 'Slavoj Zizek', 'alias' => 'Dave Thomas',
   ?>    'authored' => ['PickAxe II', 'The Prag Prog Book']} )
   {"name" => "Slavoj Zizek",
    "authored" => ["PickAxe II", "The Prag Prog Book"],
    "alias" => "Dave Thomas"}
  </pre>


  See, make sure to use @amarshal-pretty@ to get nicely laid out inlines.
