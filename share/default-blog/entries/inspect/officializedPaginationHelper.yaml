  Regarding the "story":/inspect/aPaginationHelperForRails.html last week on the
  PaginationHelper for Rails, its author has updated the code and enhanced
  documentation.  You can still paginate using the @Paginator@ class directly or
  the helper can automatically paginate.


  To automate pagination for all controllers:


  <pre>
   class PersonController < ApplicationController
     helper :pagination
     model :person

     paginate :people, :order_by => 'last_name, first_name',
              :per_page => 20
   end
  </pre>


  To automate pagination for a single controller action:


  <pre>
   def list
     @person_pages, @people =
       paginate :people, :order_by => 'last_name, first_name'
   end
  </pre>


  Sam Stephenson has really done a great job with this release, good of him to
  take the suggestions from the @Paginator@ I offered last week and mix them up
  with the variety of other contributions offered by users of this fine Rails
  helper.


  Anyway, it's new home is
  "here":http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/show/PaginationHelper. Well done.
