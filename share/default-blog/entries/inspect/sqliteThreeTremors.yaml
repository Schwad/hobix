  * "SQLite3 Tutorial":http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/1428/, an exhaustive,
  code-drenched tour.  Talks about triggers, embedding, virtual tables, custom
  functions.

  * "SQLite3 for
  Ruby":http://www.jamisbuck.org/jamis/blog.cgi/programming/ruby/SQLite3%20Bindings%20for%20Ruby_20041219215155.tx, an alpha-level binding by Jamis Buck.
