  Two array-related behaviors that took me off-guard this week.


  Zsban Ambrus displayed this technique for ignoring a list assignment.


  <pre>
   >> x, (*), z = [:x, :y, :z]
   => [:x, :y, :z]
   >> x
   => :x
   >> z
   => :z
  </pre>


  And Christian Neukirchen showed the spooky split that the array constructor
  function does.


  <pre>
   >> Array("foo\nbar")
   => ["foo\n", "bar"]
   >> $/ = ' '; Array( "i'm in your house" )
   => ["i'm ", "in ", "your ", "house"]
  </pre>
