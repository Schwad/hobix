title: C-Style For Loops Are Messed Up!

  After coding in Ruby for four years now, it's finally beginning to dawn on me
  how syntactically awful some traditional control structures are.  The worst of
  which is the @for@ loop!!


  I mean look at this!


  <pre>
   for ( i = 0; i < strlen( poem ); i++ ) {
     printf( "%d", poem[i] );
   }
  </pre>


  I have used this structure almost daily--and I'm sure it ultimately averages out
  to daily--for like a decade.  Which is definitely evidence of its usefulness. 
  But the triple expression, consisting of initiator, terminator, and incrementor,
  is truly hideous.


  What blows my mind is that, though some of C's legacy doesn't carry on, this
  structure pervades PHP, Perl, Java and other C offspring.  On the other hand, I
  wonder how I would feel about the syntax if more control structures used this
  kind of multiple expression setup.
