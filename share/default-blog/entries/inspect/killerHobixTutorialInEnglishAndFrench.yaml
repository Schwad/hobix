  Frederick Ros has done an incredible job thoroughly exploring the basics of
  Hobix (the blogging software RedHanded uses) in his series of "Hobix
  tutorials":http://sl33p3r.free.fr/hobix-tutorials/hobix-tutorials.html. 


  His first tutorial covers installation and -- to the last detail -- he guides
  you through the automated installer and setting up blogs.   Complete with
  screenshots and such.


  His second tutorial is absolutely _essential_.  Particularly the section on
  Quick templates.  A Quick template is an ERb template broken up into chunks
  which can be overridden or reused.  These templates have saved my life on
  RedHanded.  In most cases I wanted to use the default look, but I wanted to
  customize the entry footer or the sidebar organization.  *I just had to create a
  Quick template that only defined those elements.*  Defaults filled in the rest.


  He illustrates this customization by adding an @index.html.quick@ template,
  which alters the display of the date header.


  <pre>
     day_header: |
       <h2 class="dayHeader"><%= day.strftime( "%A, %B %d, %Y" ) %></h2>
  </pre>

  been organizing the old Hobix Tips of the Day into

  these fine gentlemen for pitching in!
