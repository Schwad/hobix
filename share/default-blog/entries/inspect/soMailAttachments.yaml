  A couple days ago, the topic was @RubyMail@.  Dan Berger's question was: how to
  do attachments.  I didn't look deep enough to figure out what the answer was.


  But "here's a script":http://sonic64.hp.infoseek.co.jp/2004-10-09.html called
  @samail@ from Japan.  The script is halfway down the page and is designed to be
  used like so:


  <pre>
   $ samail -v --to "redhanded@infoseek.jp example@example.com" \
       --from redhanded@infoseek.jp --smtp smtp.example.com \
       --attachment "logo.png /tmp/backup.tar.bz2"
  </pre>


  Bit more complicated version 0.4
  "here":http://sonic64.hp.infoseek.co.jp/2004-11-01.html.  Bunch of "GMail
  scripts":http://sonic64.hp.infoseek.co.jp/2004-11-09.html#2004-11-09-1 to go
  with it. (seen on "del.icio.us/eban":http://del.icio.us/eban.)
