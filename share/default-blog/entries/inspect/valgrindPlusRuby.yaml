content: "Oh, one other bit from Tanaka-san:
  \"valgrind-ruby\":http://cvs.m17n.org/viewcvs/ruby/valgrind-ruby/. I've been
  using valgrind to debug and de-leak Syck lately and this script masks the
  conditional jump warning which Ruby's GC causes.  There's also a variant
  floating around  \"by
  matju\":http://www.artengine.ca/viewcvs/*checkout*/gridflow/extra/ruby.valgrind
  which is supposed to suppress similiar behaviors in libc.
