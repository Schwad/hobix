  I know alot of you out there are using Erb syntax for your @rthtml@ files in
  Rails.  Erb is also used in Hobix and Soks.  Well, did you know that you can
  mark Erb lines with an initial percent symbol, saving yourself the messiness of
  open and close brackets?


  This:


  <pre>
   <% entries.each do |e| %>
     <div class="entryTitle"><%= e.title %></div>
     <div class="entryBody">
       <%= e.content.to_html %>
     </div>
   <% end %>
  </pre>


  Can also be expressed as:


  <pre>
   % entries.each do |e|
     <div class="entryTitle"><%= e.title %></div>
     <div class="entryBody">
       <%= e.content.to_html %>
     </div>
   % end
  </pre>


  I find it especially nice for loops, since I can easily browse the file for
  those marked lines. (More on Erb syntax in "the
  docs":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html.)
