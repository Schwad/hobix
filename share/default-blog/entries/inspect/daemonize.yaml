  Here's one from an RAA dig a few weeks ago.  Wanting to turn some of my Ruby
  jobs into daemons, I went looking for anything slightly formal.  And
  "Daemonize":http://grub.ath.cx/daemonize/ is 59 lines of Ruby that fits just
  right.


  <pre>
   require 'daemonize'
   include Daemonize

   daemonize()
   loop do
     # Your code cycles here
   end
  </pre>


  @Daemonize@ will safely fork, retrying if the maximum process limit has been
  reached.  It detaches from the controlling terminal, resets the cwd and umask,
  then closes all file descriptors.  And so my little scripts buzz around
  noiselessly.
