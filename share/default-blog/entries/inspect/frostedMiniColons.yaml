  It must have been around revision
  "1.260":http://www.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/ruby/parse.y.diff?r1=1.260;r2=1.259;f=h
  of parse.y that colons came into expression play.  And, progressively, colons
  are getting more airtime in Ruby 1.9.  Yet another thing I forgot to mention in
  "What's Shiny and New in Ruby
  1.8.0?":http://whytheluckystiff.net/articles/rubyOneEightOh.html


  Rather handy for laying out a short @if..elsif@ series:


  <pre>
   unit_of_time =
     if num < 60:              "second"
     elsif num < 60 * 60:      "minute"
     elsif num < 60 * 60 * 24: "hour"
     else                      "day"
     end
  </pre>


  Also, in @case..when@:


  <pre>
   unit_of_time =
     case num
     when 0..60:           "second"
     when 0..60 * 60:      "minute"
     when 0..60 * 60 * 24: "hour"
     else                  "day"
     end
  </pre>


  Did you know you can also use keyword @then@ in place of all the colons above?


  And if you want to your colon use to come to a head, try this in Ruby 1.9:


  <pre>
    me = {name: "_why", url: "http://redhanded.hobix.com",
          photo: "http://whytheluckystiff.net/i.home/boy.gif"}
  </pre>
