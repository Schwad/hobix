  Let me also take a moment to introduce this site.  As you'll notice, RedHanded
  has five primary sections:


  * *5.gets*: short 5-question interviews with Ruby masters.

  * *bits*: short bits of Ruby code for dissection or amazement.

  * *inspect*: open analysis of a concept, howtos.

  * *the cult*: how Ruby affects our lifestyle.

  * *-h*: urgent Ruby help topics.


  Anyway, we'll see what this turns into.  Please, if you have a topic you'd like
  to see recorded herein, pass an "e-mail":redhanded@hobix.com.  But beware.  If
  you start submitting too many juicy stories, I'm gonna coerce you into joining
  the blog.  This could happen.


  I'm busy fixing a number of issues in Konqueror and Safari this morning, please
  pardon if you're seeing some unintended juxtaposition.  My appreciation to Mark
  Hubbart and Lyle Johnson who are helping me work this out.
