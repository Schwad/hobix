  The full source and entry data for RedHanded is now  "available from
  CVS":http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/blog-redhanded.hobix.com/?cvsroot=hobix
  at Rubyforge.  You'll need to get "Hobix":http://hobix.com/ in order to build
  the site.  The site only contains a few customizations, most found in
  @lib/local.rb@.


  I wanted to put the site in source control anyway, so I figured I'd let you all
  follow along, in case you want to see a Hobix site in action or access
  RedHanded's full post and content data, stored in simple YAML streams in the
  @entries@ directory.

  Sorry about the broken comments.  I added a @to_s@ right in Hobix's bicycle
  spokes!!  Site is healed.
