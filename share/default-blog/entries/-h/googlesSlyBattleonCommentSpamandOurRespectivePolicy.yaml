  It's great to hear that Google has started a simple solidarity "against web
  spam":http://www.google.com/googleblog/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html. 
  The gist of it is:


  <pre>
   <a rel="nofollow" href="http://spamjockey.com/">Spam Jockey!!</a>
  </pre>


  You add the @rel="nofollow"@ to external links in your Wiki or blog.  Google
  (and other cooperating search engines) ignore those links.  In time, spammers
  will get the picture and leave Wikis and blogs alone.  It's a noble effort and I
  think it's worthwhile.


  For now, I'm not going to touch this, though.  I want comments here to be
  weighed in Google's search results.  Our topic is just so specific and our
  readership rather small in contrast to so many sites.


  When spam becomes a problem, though, external links here will be tagged with
  @rel="nofollow"@.  I'd like to couple it with a technique for approving links.
