  Three steps!! Just like Instiki!!


  # Install "Vim":http://vim.org and "Cadaver":http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/. 
  Download the hacked "netrw.vim":http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/netrw.vim
  you'll need that just fixes a few WebDAV issues I was having.  Put that in
  @$VIM/plugins/netrw.vim@.  And then you'll need
  "potwiki.vim":http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=1018. 
  Just put it in the current directory for now.  Open up the @potwiki.vim@ for
  editing.  Replace @call s:default('home',"~/Wiki/HomePage")@ with @call
  s:default('home',"dav://www.sharemation.com/whytheluckystiff/wiki/HomePage")@.
  Run vim.  Type @:source potwiki.vim@.  Use @\ww@ to load up the wiki's HomePage.

  # There is no step three!!


  If you're feeling left out, at least you have
  "txt":https://www.sharemation.com/whytheluckystiff/wiki/.  Just fine.
