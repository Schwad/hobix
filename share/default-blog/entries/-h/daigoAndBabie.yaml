  I guess things are really happening around here.  I figured I'd start a Ruby
  blog and do it well.  And now I'm wanting to just keep pushing it and see what
  comes off it.


  With the help of Matz, I've recruited two excellent new bloggers from Japan to
  help out here.  This is an experiment to see if we can get a multi-national blog
  to work well.   This is a good chance for both of these guys to make friends
  outside of Japan and for all of us to hear more about their lives in Ruby's
  homeland.


  *Daigo Moriwaki*, a Debian developer from Tokyo will start first.  I will
  feature an interview with him on Monday and then he'll talk about Japanese New
  Year with the  Tokyo Ruby crowd.  *Michiaki Baba* (Babie) from Kyoto, who works
  on Rubyist Magazine, will start a day later.  Again, with an interview.  He's
  expressed some interest in reporting on Matz' blog.


  (_Excited!!_)


  Both Daigo and Babie speak pretty good English.  Still, I'll ask you to refrain
  from pick aparting their grammar when they start posting.  It's just a blog, you
  know?
