  I've been getting reports for the last week or so about problems in Safari.  The
  right column is weaving into-around-behind the main blog content.


  I have no Mac anywhere at all.  So, we're going to play a little game.


  *If you have Safari, you get to say "nope" until I get it right.*


  *Then, you get to say "yep."*


  And if you don't have Safari: eh, aren't there plenty of other places you can
  talk around here??
