  the little chewy core of CSS(Cascading Style Sheets).  I'll go through the
  code and give you the images, in case you want to rip them off and use them
  on your own sites and tirelessly brag about them.

  Ibraheem Umaru-Mohammed wrote yesterday, asking how the day header boxes work
  that you see to the right on the front page.  Since this site is primarily comprised of @div@ elements,
  such things only require a bit of css trickery.  And you can find a wealth of
  "css":http://del.icio.us/tag/css tutorials around, including the 
  "teaser box":http://www.456bereastreet.com/lab/teaser/one_image.html and the
  "trashbox":http://www.vertexwerks.com/tests/sidebox/.


  Adding a daily box to Hobix is really simple.  In your @hobix.yaml@, you simply
  override the default @day_header@ chunk for your Quick template.  Like so:


  <pre>
   - hobix/out/quick:
       day_header: |
         <div class="dayHeader">
         <div class="dayBox">
           <!-- The full weekday name -->
           <h2><%= day.strftime( "%A" ) %></h2>
           <!-- The date in YYYY.MM.DD format, with each
                part of the date linked to the appropriate archive. -->
           <h3><a href="/<%= day.year %>/"><%= day.year %></a>.<a 
             href="<%= day.strftime( "/%Y/%m/" ) %>"><%= 
               day.strftime( "%m" ) %></a>.<a 
             href="<%= day.strftime( "/%Y/%m/%d.html" ) %>"><%= 
               day.strftime( "%d" ) %></a></h3>
         </div>
         </div>
  </pre>


  I have an empty file called @index.html.quick-summary@ in my @skel@ directory, so I
  get an index page that uses the default template with summarized entries. Overriden
  chunks (like the above) apply to @.quick@, @.quick-archive@ and @.quick-summary@
  template files.


  The HTML above consists of two @div@ elements: one with class @dayHeader@ and, inside,
  one with class @dayBox@.  The weekday name is an @h2@.  The date is an @h3@.


  Then, I made two images in Photoshop.  A left-side edge, which extends to the right as far
  as I'd like the box to stretch.  And a right-side edge, which is short.


  <div style="padding-left: 150px;"><div style="float:left; padding-right:20px; text-align:center;">_boxleft.gif_<br />!/images/redhanded-boxleft.gif!</div><div style="float:left; text-align:center;">_boxright.gif_<br />!/images/redhanded-boxright.gif!</div></div><br clear="all" />


  There are likely better ways to do this, but I was in a rush and I wanted to start posting
  all this great news, you know??  So, I positioned the stretch images as the lower background
  and the short image as the higher background.  The higher background is placed @top right@
  in the style definition and always covers up the excess stretch.


  So, here's the style definition I popped in my @site.css@:


  <pre>
   .dayHeader {
       background: url(/images/redhanded-boxleft.gif) no-repeat top left;
       float: right;
       margin: 0px 5px;
       text-align: center;
   }
   
   .dayBox {
       background: url(/images/redhanded-boxright.gif) no-repeat top right;
       padding: 9px 10px 12px 10px;
   }
  </pre>


  The @float: right@ was used to push the header boxes to the right and let the
  blog text flow around it.  Which I think turned out really nice.
