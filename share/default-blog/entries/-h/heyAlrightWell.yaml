  This is just a note to readers.  And flgr, too.  It's a scribbly note about this
  site.


  Part of the note is in response to the hundreds of active, new readers that join
  RH every week.  On this topic, the note is clear: Welcome to the place and
  please feel comfortable speaking directly into the blog.  (RedHanders know
  there's no comment too shallow or irrelevant.  I don't mop up.)


  But the note goes on with respect to the lingering denizen who have extended
  accounts with RH.  You guys out there linking and pushing me news and offering
  fixes and pruning the site.  Yeah, you.  You're good.  You turn blogging into a
  carpeted wheelbarrow with comet wheels and a auto-reverse tape deck.  And Hall &
  Oates is preloaded!!  Believe that!!
