  Hi!  Welcome to the redesign blog.  The Vit-Core team -- the four of us working
  together to build a better Ruby-Lang -- have had a great time over the last two
  weeks.  If you happened across this page by accident, we are working to give
  "ruby-lang.org":http://ruby-lang.org a new face. 


  And, if you've been following closely, I think you'll agree that we've come
  along way since "this":/cult/rubyorgMockup.html.


  Our team has been through a dizzying array of designs and today we present our
  two favorites.  Be advised that there are variations of these designs that we
  are still considering.  But these two represent the bounding edges of our work. 
  The designs share some similarities -- those are the things we've agreed upon.
  The designs differ in places were we are still experimenting.  And there are
  omissions.


  In this blog, each design will receive its own blog post, to allow specific
  comments.  If you have general comments, leave them here in this post.  Or head
  over to the "vit-discuss list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/vit-discuss
  for more exhaustive commentary.


  Here are questions we'd like you to keep in mind (and hopefully answer) in
  relation to these two designs:


  * What logo should we use?  Is it important to choose one that would also work
  embroidered / printed on a T-shirt, or is one that is designed for a computer
  screen ok?

  * What intro text should we use?

  * Should we have sample code, or not?  If so, what would be a good sample?

  * Package management is in flux right now.  Should we link any or all of RAA,
  Rubyforge, RubyGems and RPA?

  * Are there any really high priority links or other content that are missing
  from the site? 

  * What information on the current Ruby-Lang site do you find yourself coming
  back for presently?


  Thanks to Curt Hibbs for his help and input.  And mucking around with the
  mailing list, o' course.
