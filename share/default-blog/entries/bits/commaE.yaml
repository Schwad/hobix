  Gorou's 2nd Life is a blog from Ruby's homeland (.jp) which has a nifty
  "trick":http://d.hatena.ne.jp/secondlife/20050107/1105029582 if you  edit your
  YAML documents in Vim.  (Which I do for this blog.)  Comma-e spits your YAML out
  in a Ruby structure, a decent quick validation.


  <pre style="clear:both;">
   autocmd FileType yaml nmap ,e :execute '!ruby -ryaml -e 
     "begin;YAML::load(open('."'"."%"."'".","."'"."r"."'".').read);
     rescue ArgumentError=>e;puts e;end"'<CR>
  </pre>


  You'll need to remove line breaks in the above.
