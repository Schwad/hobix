  Premshree has written a
  "Toogle-alike":http://www.livejournal.com/users/premshree/59432.html
   in 35 lines of Ruby.  There's some very succinct PHP in the comments as well.  My heart can't take these LoC battles any more, so let's just link this one as a "oh, that's how you use GD in Ruby" sort of deal.

  I'd like to see somebody take
  "this":http://brevity.org/code/flickr/tag-o-vision/flickr_py.txt apart. 
  "Fascinating":http://www.flickr.com/photos/brevity/sets/164195/.

  And so.  "Flickr for Ruby":http://www.livejournal.com/users/premshree/60333.html
  by Premshree.  Now let's see an ASCII Flickr, huh?  Tlickr.  Naw, I'll lay off
  now.
