  Just noticed RCR 290 -- "Add warning for misspellings of
  'initialize'":http://rcrchive.net/rcr/show/290 -- which attempts to break Ruby's
  silence on method misspellings.  Here's duck typing's largest weakness, since
  functionality depends on matching method names.


  Florian Gross provides a @method_added@ hook for sniffing out imposters to
  @initialize@:


  <pre>
   class Class
     def method_added(name)
       if not private_instance_methods(false).include?("initialize") and
         name.to_s[/\Ain[^_]{1,6}li[sz]e\Z/] and name != :initialize
       then
         warn "warning: probably misspelled `initialize' as `#{name}'"
       end
     end
   end
  </pre>


  His regular expression is pretty liberal and I thought I would check for other
  possible valid matches in @/usr/share/dict/words@.


  <pre>
   $ grep -e '^in\w\{1,6\}li[sz]e$' /usr/share/dict/words
   infernalize
   infidelize
   informalize
   initialize
   insulize
   integralize
   internalize
  </pre>


  Anyway, I'd really like to start using @infernalize@ as a seamless substitute.
  Counted lucky that the decadence can begin so early.
