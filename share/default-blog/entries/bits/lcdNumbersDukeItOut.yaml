  This week's "Ruby Quiz":http://www.grayproductions.net/ruby_quiz/ (a capital
  effort by JEGII) was solved in less than 300 bytes. I can't get the 266 byte
  solution to run, so here is Jannis Harder's at 295.


  <pre>
   s=(s=$*.index"-s")?$*.slice!(s,2)[1].to_i: 2
   d,="\21\265\22H\245\10-\0\23".unpack"B*"
   f=" "
   o=48
   y=(0..4).map{""}
   $*.join.each_byte{|z|u=d[z*7-336,7]
   3.times{|x|y[x*2]<<(u[x*3]>o ?f*s+f+f:f+"-"*s+f)+f}
   [1,3].map{|x|y[x]<<(u[h=x*4/3]>o ?f:"|")+f*s+(u[h+1]>o ?f:"|")+f}}
   y[3,1]*=s
   y[1,1]*=s
   puts y
  </pre>


  Save this in @harder.rb@ and execute with @ruby harder.rb 4@.  You can control
  the size of the LCD digit with the @-s@ option.


  Yes, compressed code is unreadable.  But, hey, I get a kick out of deciphering
  this stuff and I've learned some sly shortcuts from such bits.
