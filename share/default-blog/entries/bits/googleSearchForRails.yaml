  "Technoblog":http://tech.rufy.com/entry/category/programming/ruby/. Add a search
  box to your Rails site, simply by piping to Google's SOAP endpoint.


  <pre>
   def search
     require 'soap/wsdlDriver'

     $KCODE = "UTF8" # in order to parse some of the odd characters
     key = 'yourGoogleKey'
     yoursite = 'yoursite.com'

     driver = SOAP::WSDLDriverFactory.new
      ("http://api.google.com/GoogleSearch.wsdl").createDriver
     @results = driver.doGoogleSearch(key,
      @params['q']+" site:#{yoursite}", 0, 10, true, " ", false, " ", " ", " ")
   end
  </pre>
