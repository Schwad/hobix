  By a mere accident, we talked about Haiku.

  It's perfect on the point of original Haiku that is composed of 5-7-5
  syllables(in Japanese). The result value is good, too. Gimme a break that there
  is no word means season.

  Don't escape by using literal.


  But he knows that the one by using non-execute block is not much defferent than
