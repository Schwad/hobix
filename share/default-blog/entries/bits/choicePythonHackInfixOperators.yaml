  Pencils down.  Cool hack for Python "right
  here":http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/384122.  I guess
  this was up on LtU a few days ago.  I saw it on "The
  Farm":http://farm.tucows.com/, so.


  Works like:


  <pre>
   # simple multiplication
   x=Infix(lambda x,y: x*y)
   print 2 |x| 4
   # => 8

   # class checking
   isa=Infix(lambda x,y: x.__class__==y.__class__)
   print [1,2,3] |isa| []
   print [1,2,3] <<isa>> []
   # => True

   # inclusion checking
   is_in=Infix(lambda x,y: y.has_key(x))
   print 1 |is_in| {1:'one'}
   print 1 <<is_in>> {1:'one'}
   # => True
  </pre>


  Anyway, this hacker -- Ferdinand Jamitzky -- sure would fit in well over here. 
  He's tread so close to our territory.  What with the "Ruby-like syntatic
  sugar":http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/271669 he
  supplied for Python last year.


  <pre>
   5 *times(lambda: printf("Hello"))
   [1,2,3,4] *each(lambda x: printf("Count:"+str(x)))
   print [1,2,3,4,5] *length
   ['a','b','c','d','e'] *each(lambda char: char+'!')
  </pre>


  I mean if he can make Python look like Ruby, maybe he can make Ruby look like
  dolphin sonar.  Can you best these??
