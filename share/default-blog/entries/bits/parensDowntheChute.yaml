  Robert Klemme used this @inject@ on the Ruby-Talk list today to emulate
  @Hash#values@ behavior:


  <pre>
   >> h = {"a" => "111", "b" => "222"}                                                                                      
   => {"a" => "111", "b" => "222"}
   >> h.inject([]){ |a,(k,v)| a << k << v }                                                                              
   => ["a", "111", "b", "222"] 
  </pre>


  Oh, man, using parens in block variable assignment is so classy.  It's one of
  those subtelties I constantly neglect.  Perfect for @Hash@ iterators, since you
  usually get a tuple as a block argument.


  <pre>
   >> h.each_with_index { |(k,v),i| ... }
   >> h.sort { |(ak,),(bk,)| ak <=> bk }
  </pre>
