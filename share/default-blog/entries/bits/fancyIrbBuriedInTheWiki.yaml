  Windozers, give ear.  Prithee, try this lovely little app, hidden out of site,
  which gives us a graphical face for Irb.
  "FXIrb/Experimental":http://rubygarden.org/ruby?FXIrb/Experimental by Frailis
  and Martin DeMello.  Get a nice, readable font.  Custom colors.


  So, what do you use to dress up Irb in Windows?  Use any commandline GUIs that
  don't require Cygwin or Mingw?  Rxvt for Windows is great, which comes with
  Cygwin or MSYS.

  *Update:* Looks like Martin DeMello has been contacted and coerced into opening
  a "Rubyforge project":http://rubyforge.org/projects/fxirb/ for FXIrb.  I think
  I'm gonna hit the "feature
  requests":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=1994&group_id=501&func=browse later
  today and request some hotkeys, an optional toolbar, and an interactive help. 
  It's worth submitting.
