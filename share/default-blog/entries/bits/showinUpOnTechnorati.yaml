  Among the various news aggregation portals (Bloglines, Artima, etc.), I really
  like the  layout and variety of "Technorati's ruby
  tag":http://technorati.com/tags/ruby (also linked in the right-hand column.) 
  Artima has a tendency to forget about the site for a few days here and there. 
  Technorati allows you to trigger an update by pinging its service.


  The Technorati docs are a bit sketchy, though, so I'm going to save you a bit of
  time, should you want to join in.  Here's how to add your blog to the @ruby@ tag
  on Technorati:


  <ol><li><p>Add Dublin Core @subject@ tags to each entry in your RSS or Atom
  feed, using the word "ruby" as the content.</p>

  <pre>
   <?xml version='1.0'?>
   <feed version='0.3' xml:lang='en'
     xmlns:dc='http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/' 
     xmlns='http://purl.org/atom/ns#'>

   ...


     <entry>
       <title>CashHanded #5: Merchant Tools</title>
       <dc:subject>cult</dc:subject>
       <dc:subject>ruby</dc:subject>
  </pre></li>

  <li><p>Issue "a ping":http://www.technorati.com/ping.html to your feed.  So, in
  my case, I used @http://redhanded.hobix.com/index.xml@ in the URL box.</p></li>

  <li><p>If you'd like to automate updates to Technorati,
  "setup":http://www.technorati.com/developers/pingconfig.html your blog software
  to ping Technorati.</p>

  <pre>
   begin
       server = XMLRPC::Client.new( "rpc.technorati.com",
                                    "/rpc/ping", 80 )

       begin
           result = server.call( "weblogUpdates.ping", 
                        "Your blog's name",
                        "http://your.blog.com/index.xml" )
       rescue XMLRPC::FaultException => e
           puts "Error: [#{ e.faultCode }] #{ e.faultString }"
       end
   rescue Exception => e
       puts "Error: #{ e.message }"
   end
  </pre></li>

  </ol>
