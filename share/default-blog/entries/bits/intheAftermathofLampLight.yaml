  Last week was big.  The ONLamp tutorial launched up "the
  charts":http://del.icio.us/popular along with a smattering of other Ruby links. 
  And have you noticed that Ruby is now hanging solid with Java and Python among
  the top twenty overall tags?


  Want to see how Ruby ranks overall?  Run:


  <pre>
   require 'open-uri'
   t = open("http://del.icio.us/tag/").read
   l = %w(c c++ java javascript perl php python ruby)
   l.map do |lang|
     [$1.to_f, lang] if t =~ 
       %r{/#{Regexp::quote lang}"  style="font-size: (\d+\.\d{2})}
   end.compact.sort.each do |score, lang|
     puts "#{lang}: #{score}"
   end
  </pre>


  A few highlights from the avalanche of discussion that has followed the
  ONLamp/Rolling tutorial:


  * "Really Getting Started with
  Rails":http://www.slash7.com/flashback/2005/01/oreilly_onlamp.html, a newb's
  point of view on the tutorial.  If you found any syntax confusing and don't want
  to read an entire Ruby book to get a picture of what's going on, then this is
  for you, newb.

  * Another recommendation I've seen around is to use the scaffold generator
  script rather than the @scaffold :recipe@ method.  This way you have some stub
  classes in the right places, which gives you a head start on fleshing out your
  administration tool.


  <pre>
   $ ruby scripts/generate scaffold Recipe
  </pre>
