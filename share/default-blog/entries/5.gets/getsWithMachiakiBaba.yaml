  p(intro). Here we are again with another new staff interview.  Let's welcome
  Babie, a fellow Ruby denizen from Kyoto, Japan.  He's an editor of the "Rubyist
  Magazine":http://jp.rubyist.net/magazine/ (aka _Rubima_) and is working on the
  Ruby Library Report.


  p(gets). 1. What are your favorite Ruby libraries?


  p(puts). Hmm... Error.pm is a must, Data::Dumper is a must too... Hey, it's
  Perl's :)


  p(puts). I venture an opinion for all the faults. My all-time favorite library
  is open-uri.


  <pre> $ ruby -ropen-uri -e 'open("http://jarp.jin.gr.jp/diary/") {  |f| \
   print f.read.match("<title>(.*)</title>").to_a[1].sub("port", "hack") }'
  </pre>


  p(gets). 2. Have you bought any cool gadgets lately?


  p(puts). Yes, Yes! I'm grad you said that. I bought a mini PC "Be Silent
  M6000":http://www.e-lets.co.jp/product/pc-m60l/index.htm at the end of the last
  year. It's a silent, little and bright-white beautiful box. I'll set up my site
  till the end of the month...


  p(puts). But... Mac mini was released...orz... I'm biting my lips now. I'll buy
  iPod shuffle to carry out revenge.


  p(gets). 3. Have you travelled outside of Japan much?


  p(puts). No, absolutely not. I want to go, if anything, I wanna live in an other
  country. Why don't you employ me? :-)                                           


  p(puts). I wish I could go RubyConf2005. If in Hawaii, I'll go.


  p(gets). 4. Daigo likes the Beatles.  I like the Beatles.  Do you like the
  Beatles?  Have a favorite song?


  p(puts). Oh, sorry. I don't know the Beatles particularly. Instead, I love the
  Wildhearts.  A long time ago, they were likened to "METALLICA meets The
  Beatles". I went as far as to be in the inferior copy band.                     

                                                                
  p(puts). I love "bjork", "in flames" and many more, in foreign musicians, too.


  p(gets). 5. (Since I left out the fifth question, Babie added his own fifth
  question!) Why did you join the RedHanded?


  p(puts). Because,


  # English studying.

  # RedHanded is funny, stylin' and very readable.

  # I wanna contribute to Ruby, cuz I'm grateful to Ruby for daily help. I think
  that you are happy if I will introduce the hot topic about Ruby on matz blog.
  The reason of joining the Rubyist Magzine editors and the study meeting in
  Kansai supporter is the same.


  p(puts). The other reason is "I Wanna Go Where The People Go".
