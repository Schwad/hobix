  So, we have some designs for you.  After two weeks of designing and remixing the
  current ruby-lang.org, our four-man team has put up the new "Redesign 2005
  Blog":/redesign2005/ with two gorgeous designs by John W. Long and Michel
  Martens.  We're going to take some feedback and then duck back down into our
  foxhole and plow away again.


  While Ben Giddings and I don't have the pixel wizardry of John and Michel, our
  effect is present in these designs.  Especially Ben, who was a constant source
  of structural ideas.  I've really had a great time working on this.  Can't wait
  to see where we are in another few weeks.
