  I don't eat sushi, but I do like to wrap a few popcorns up in a spinach leaf
  every once in a while.  Now aren't these "sushi-styled USB
  drives":http://sa-store.com/shop.php?category_id=25&item01_id=37 the perfect
  little fish egg housing for your Soks?  If only.  If only they were really
  edible.  In case you needed to discreetly eliminate personal data without a
  trace.


  I'm surprised there's not a USB drive composed entirely from tofu.  Or hemp I
  guess.  Or duct tape I guess.  Or soylent green I guess.  "Oh, and glowing
  ducks":http://sa-store.com/shop.php?category_id=32&item01_id=49.  (courtesy of
