  Hey, imagine if you could do this with your wiki:  Create new
  RecentChanges-style pages with custom criteria.  Something like:


  <pre>
   # Automatically generated summary of new 
   # pages whose title starts with 'blog'
   AutomaticSummary.new( wiki,
     :regexp_for_pages => /^NBlog/i,
     :max_pages_to_show => 10,
     :pagename => 'Recent Blog Entries',
     :only_new_pages => true
   )
  </pre>


  Yeah, well, this works in
  "Soks":http://soks.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl?HowToInstall.  I tried to hack
  this into Instiki and it exploded and flew outta my hands.  (_Bonus: there's a
  gross exaggeration in this paragraph.  See if you can find it!_)


  <pre>
   gem install soks
   cd /var/www
   soks-create-wiki.rb  # runs WEBrick
  </pre>


  You can then edit the settings of @soks-wiki/start.rb@ to your hostname and
  authentication scheme. Then, run @soks-wiki/start.rb@ and be off.
