  Curt Hibbs is telling the Rails list that Bruce Tate and David Geary -- authors
  of _Core Java Server Faces_, _Core JSTL_, _Better, Faster, Lighter Java_ and so
  on -- have signed with O'Reilly to write the _Rails Developer Notebook_.  These
  two guys have had quite an adventure with Rails, especially considering the
  "gargantuan debate":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000408.html we overheard
  between Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson and David Geary just a month ago.
  _A month later, he's collaborating on a book??  Holy coats!!_


  But, seriously, what is happening?? Who ever caves on these arguments?? You're
  supposed to stay "firmly
  planted":http://whytheluckystiff.net/comics/holyBible9.html in your stance,
  right??


  DHH needs to come to OSCON in a big Kool-Aid man suit and bust through the
  bricks and start baptizing people.


  Also see the news on "Pragmatic Rails
  Recipes":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/03/21/new-cook-coming-pragmatic-rails-recipes.
  Let's get our own shelf by year's end, okay??
