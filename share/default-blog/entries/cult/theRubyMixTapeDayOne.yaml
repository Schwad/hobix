  Enough coding already.  Let's put it to work.  Get out flgr's "six-line
  p2p":/ruby-talk/123945 and point it at @druby://redhanded.hobix.com:4114@.  The
  password is @mixtape@.  Download all mp3s.  Each day this week, we're blogging
  two songs with any slight relevance.  (Whilst steering clear of certain UB40 and
  Chris De Burgh.)


  Today I bring you two songs which share a birthplace with Ruby.


  h2. Kazumi Nikaidoh "Pulsation"


  If there's one Japanese artist I can recommend, here she is.  I heard her voice
  and wandered into a building and there she was, teetering around the stage,
  strumming her guitar, tilting her head, singing off into the ceiling, high notes
  like a powdered mouse, low notes like a vampire's cloud.  The closest my spinal
  cord's ever gotten to being plugged straight into a wall socket.


  Her songs are Ruby.  The loose structure, the voices up and down.  Her album has
  two really cool videos.  One's her wandering around a zoo and the other is a
  science project.  Both on her album _You Dropped Something Again, Didn't You?_,
  which looks to be still available.  "2,100 yen
  only.":http://www.ontonson.com/label/poetportraits/release_e/ppr-36cd.html 


  h2. Cornelius "New Music Machine"


  This song is the moment Ruby clicks and your mind opens to all the little
  proggies you're going to write in the next ten, twenty, fifty years.  Your brain
  says, "Oh, wow, I'm on the edge! I'm blurting thoughts in a futuristic
  language!"  And you're reading source code for drb or Ruby/X11 and all the
  ghosts from Pac-Man are gathered on your nose cheering, having pixel pizza.  Go,
  little, nuby! Go!


  From his album _Fantasma_, available basically anywhere.

  Hey, if anyone out there gets a hankering to run a server, post it here in the
  comments, willya?  And that's how friendship pours through the streets and
  villages of Rubyland.
