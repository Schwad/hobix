  Story goes: someone at Amazon DevCon asked Python creator Guido about Ruby.  And
  he goes, "seems like an accident attempt in cleaning up Perl." 
  "Gulp.":http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2005/01/amazon_devcon_g_5.html  


  Was anyone present for this?  Did he have his collar upturned and his shades on?
  Too cool for school, Guido. (via
  "~matz":http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/20050126.html#p02)


  <div class="update">


  *So:* I guess "another
  scribe":http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2005/01/amazon_devcon_g_4.html recorded
  "excellent" rather than "accident".  From now on, let's operate on the
  assumption that he said "excrement."


  No, seriously, "excellent" makes more sense.
