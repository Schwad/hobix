  Think about this.  A red lipstick USB drive with Ruby goods on it.  A lovely
  little stocking stuffer for a RedHanded friend!


  The red Hyundai drive pictured to the left is an import from China.  You can buy
  these guys off
  "eBay":http://search.ebay.com/lipstick-flash-drive_W0QQfromZR40QQsojsZ1 for a
  small sack of change.


  In light of recent mascot talk on Ruby, might I also suggest the "devil ducky
  drive":http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/devil-duckie-usb-flash-memory-drive-015955.php
  ThinkGeek doesn't sell these anymore, so you're stuck with the "Swiss
  Army USB drive":http://www.thinkgeek.com/gadgets/electronic/6b3b/, if you're
  bent on red.


  Anyway, here's a few ideas for what you could house in this little pill:

  # An "Instiki":http://instiki.org/ would be ideal!  I use a wiki to brainstorm
  projects and stockpile ideas.  Moving my Instiki to a USB drive would ensure
  privacy and allow me to use the wiki without latency.

  # A bootable "RubyX":http://www.rubyx.org/ distribution.  I don't necessarily
  want to partition my drive or run RubyX exclusively.  A USB drive would allow a
  contained unit where I could play with this little OS.  In addition, it might be
  nice to boot into Ruby quickly on a laptop and have a full-screen Irb console.

  # A self-contained "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org/ application.  How cool would it be during a discussion
  on web frameworks?  You plug in the drive and demonstrate your app using
  WEBrick.

  # And, of course, you could brew your own installer kit.  Include the installer
  for "Windows":http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org/ or for
  "OSX":http://homepage.mac.com/discord/Ruby/. Weave in some
  "documentation.":http://www.ruby-doc.org/docs/  A few
  "gems.":http://rubygems.rubyforge.org/ And a "peer-to-peer
  app":http://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/aFileSharingParagraph.html of course.
