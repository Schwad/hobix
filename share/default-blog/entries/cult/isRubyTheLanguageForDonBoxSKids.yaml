  I've always had a premonition that Ruby will eventually live out its retirement
  as a reclusive elite, a language only used by the children of the wealthy and
  eccentric.  They'll use it to hack into each other's private jets, forcing the
  robotic arms to serve the passengers -- in place of sparkling apple spritz -- a
  sordid concotion of french cologne and rabbit's tears.


  Well, since I know some of you also have been haranguing your kids into learning
  Ruby, perhaps you can offer some advice to Don Box (SOAP author and Microsoft
  wizard) as he "selects a language for his
  kids.":http://pluralsight.com/blogs/dbox/archive/2005/02/20/6009.aspx  He's
  listed Ruby as a favorable candidate, given that it's both elegant and is
  enjoying wider usage.  Don, I'll have to dig out that replacement cassette I
  made for the Teddy Ruxpin that covers Singletons And The Grasshopper Dirigible.


  Also see: "Chapter Five":http://poignantguide.net/ruby/chapter-5.html of the
  (Poignant) Guide, wherein I converse at length with my daughter's organ
  instructor.

  bq. After reading the Pickaxe book, I love Ruby, at least for my own use.


  Looks like the hot contenders are "DrScheme":http://www.drscheme.org/ and Ruby
  now.  So, really, the competition should be between DrScheme and
  "FreeRIDE":http://freeride.rubyforge.org/ or
  "FxIrb":http://rubyforge.org/projects/fxirb/.
