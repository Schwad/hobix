  On his journal, Matz has illustrated some
  "differences":http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/20050114.html#p03 between Ruby
  classes and Python classes, running some examples through the Python
  interpreter.  He largely dwells on the syntax for retrieving a method list for
  an integer type.  I think he's awfully proud of Ruby's elegance in this matter,
  which is cool with me.


  In Python:


  <pre>
   >>> (1).__class__.__dict__.keys()
   ['__int__', '__ror__', '__rtruediv__', ... ]
  </pre>


  In Ruby:


  <pre>
   >> 1.methods
   => ["%", "between?", "method", "send", ... ]
  </pre>

  This just a few days after he mentioned using the "encoding 
  pragma":http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/4192 from
  Python's PEP 263 in a future release of Ruby.
