  The Mogok Valley is said to be the producer of the world's finest rubies.  Seems
  like an ideal spot for RubyConf.  I mean why not choose a spot that's far from
  all of us?


  bq. Everybody is familiar with the curious phenomenon that a single slope of a
  hill will produce a wine of a delicate and rare bouquet, which no other vineyard
  in the same neighborhood or in any other region can equal. And again, that a
  particular valley in Cuba will grow a tobacco of choice aroma which can be
  equaled in no other spot. So is it in the mineral world with the best rubies.
  These have always been found in the Mogok Valley, in Upper Burma, a valley which
  is perhaps two miles long and of an average breadth of about half a mile. From
  this small tract have been produced all the best stones of the finest colour,
  and in former times one of the recognized titles of the Kings of Burma was that
  of 'Lord of the Rubies.'

  The Romance of the Jewel


  A ruby discovered in Mogok Valley was appraised by comparing its color to the
  first two drops spilled from a freshly slain pigeon onto a highly polished
  silver plate.  Legend has it that the first Ruby was discovered by an eagle who
  mistook it for a hunk of meat.  This is a mistake, though.  We who know, know it
  was a duck.  (via "Pigeon's Blood -- a pilgrimage to
