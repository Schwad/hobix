  With air travel prices recently dropping in the U.S., you can score a bunch of
  "round-trip
  flights":http://www.orbitz.com/App/GetDealsDetailsContent?deal_id=air_dl_restructure_010505&source=hp&type=s
  for down in the $100-200 range.  Try and pair with someone in a qualifying city.
  Seattle folks can make it down to Oakland for $190.  New Yorkers can hit Boston
  or Florida for about a hundred bucks.


  Find your city and ask around on the #ruby-lang or #rubyonrails channels.  Find
  out if anyone will receive you and code with you.  If you live in a major city,
  offer to host a few guests and head up the codefest.  With $500 you could fly in
  two or three.


  So here's a point-blank suggestion for you.  %{font-size:large}New York Rubyists
  should fly in William Morgan and get a tracker library built for his BitTorrent
  lib.%  He's in "Boston":http://all-thing.net/About/William%20Morgan.html and
  he's a tremendously helpful guy.  Started Hobix hacking all the sudden without
  provocation.



  If you live in Oakland, fly in Eric Hodel or Ryan Davis. If you live in L.A, fly
  in Ara Howard or Jamis Buck to help.  Aredridel is in Colorado, right? Get her
  out.


  Sorry, Gavin Sinclair.  $500 isn't going to make a dent in your strandedness.
