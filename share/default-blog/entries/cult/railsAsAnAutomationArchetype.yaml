  I know you guys can't get enough of this Rails thing.  _It's teh pop0lar href!!_
  Follow that train.  Mike Clark has
  "interviewed":http://www.pragmaticautomation.com/cgi-bin/pragauto.cgi/Tools/RailsAutomation.rdoc
  David Heinemeier Hansson on automation in Rails.


  bq. *Mike:* Sounds like you’ve tried to automate everything that will be the
  same on most projects.


  bq. *David:* We basically try to make it so that the only thing you need to
  create is application-specific functionality. All the infrastructure is already
  configured and ready to run. That means it’s much, much easier to get off to a
  good start with testing, revision control (we backup your DB schema for you),
  and the like.


  bq. So even though we call it a Rails skeleton, when you create a new empty
  application, it’s actually more a fully fleshed, but undressed body you’re
  dealing with (yeah, Rails is that sexy :)).


  I'm positive you Railsickos get off on this kind of stuff.  (Listen close and
  hear the sound of #rubyonrails collectively issuing _/me swoons_.)
