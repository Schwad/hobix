  Yeah, so, I really appreciate the support Bruce Eckel has shown this last year. 
  He came outta nowhere and just started being my friend and encouraging my work
  on _Why's (Poignant) Guide_.  Which is cool because I really owe _Thinking in
  Java_ for being (1) the first coding book I ever read for free over the Net, and
  (2) for getting me back into programming when I was young and couldn't afford
  the traditional price for information.


  And so it ups the ante on the _Guide_, because now I have all these legendary
  bastards reading along.  (_Smiley._)


  Part of being Bruce Eckel must suck, because everybody's hittin him up to give a
  statement on Ruby.  Surely, this coding behemoth must have the wherewithal to be
  enticed by Ruby's intoxicating design!  Is he not pragmatic?  Is he not gifted
  with proper goggles to see this beauty?  A smite upon his ankles and upon his
  family's ankles!!


  Well, "his statement is
  here":http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/thinking-in-ruby-not.html. I like
  where he compares Ruby to Pennsylvania Dutch.  But I'm way into colloquialism,
  so.
