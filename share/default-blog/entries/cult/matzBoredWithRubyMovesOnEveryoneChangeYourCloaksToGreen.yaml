  From Matz:


  bq. I'm pleased to announce you the first public release of "emerald
  0.1":http://rubyurl.com/b5JtE.


  bq. Emerald is an object oriented language with constraints and logic features,
  inspired from prolog, Oz, CSP and Hyper/J.


  bq. I started this as an hack since ruby is becoming less fun.

  It will not be as good as ruby, but please try it out while we wait for Rite.


  This is alpha stuff, I wasn't able to load it onto anything with an x86
  processor.  I had to pull out one of my old solid-state frying pans -- but now
  I'm cooking.


  Lots of "great reaction":/ruby-talk/135964-136352/136254 from the community, who
  understandably have questions aplenty:


  bq. Hal Fulton asks, "Very nice... but will it scale?"


  bq. Tom Copeland says, "I feel gillty for recommending Ruby now."


  Good stuff but my favorite is Matz' mission statement above: 


  bq. It will not be as good as ruby, but please try it out.
