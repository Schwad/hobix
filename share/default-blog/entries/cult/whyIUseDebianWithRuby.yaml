title: Why I Use Debian With Ruby

  Some debian developers discussed the split of Ruby standard libraries and gave a
  proposal to add two new packages and change the meaning of the current 'ruby'
  package at the debian-ruby list ("not archived
  yet":http://lists.debian.org/debian-ruby/2005/01/threads.html) (I need to modify
  dependency lines in my tDiary packages).  I am sure that it will soon be
  available and I'd like to say "Wait a minute, it is too early to leave Debian."


  I like Debian's Ruby because "Ukai-san":http://ukai.org/d/ and
  "Yamada-san":http://arika.org/diary/ are members of "its
  maintainers":http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/ruby1.8.html. They are super
  hackers of Debian and Ruby. Ukai-san is the leader of
  "Debian.jp":http://www.debian.or.jp/ and the president of "Japan Linux
  Association":http://jla.linux.or.jp/. Yamada-san seems to maintain Vine's Ruby
  also, however, make Debian's package at first.


  See the changelog.Debian.gz at /usr/share/doc/ruby1.8 in Debian. You can find
  Debian's Ruby more stable than the original. I appreciate their contribution. I
  cite a recent entry. Who else can do that?
