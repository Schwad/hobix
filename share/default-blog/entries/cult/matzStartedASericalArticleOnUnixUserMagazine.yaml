  On "UNIX USER magazine":http://www.unixuser.jp/, which is published monthly,
  Matz started a serial article titled "Hacker's Life". The first article
  described the definition of "a hacker", citing the words of Larry Wall, the
  creator of Perl: three virtues of hackers are laziness, impatience and hubris.
  They sound vice so please search what he really means.


  I am glad to be able to read his new article although it is only two pages. I
  hope he would write about Ruby as well as hacker's culture.
