  You can't go anywhere without reading about metaprogramming in Ruby.  I tried
  passing through a turnstyle on my way out of the arcade tonight and -- boof -- a
  whole blog on meta stuff was jammed right there!!


  Oliver Steele, creator of Lazlo, just got done talking all
  "admirably":http://osteele.com/archives/2005/03/ruby-and-laszlo about Ruby's
  meta.  I agree.  The ability to add to @Class@ and use those methods like a
  definition -- that's the stuff railsers lick straight from the raw honeycomb. 
  He compares some Ruby and Lazlo snips, which rules if you want a taste of Lazlo.


  Okay, so, ready for some real metaprogramming code??  Aslak Hellesoy has offered
  a simple "bit o'
  annotations":http://blogs.codehaus.org/people/rinkrank/archives/000994_annotations_in_ruby.html
  for attaching arbitrary metadata to a class.  Perfect.  Thank Curt Hibbs on your
  way out, he's the one who floated this on to Ruby-Talk.
