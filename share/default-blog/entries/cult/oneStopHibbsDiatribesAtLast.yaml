  Yeah, just: "Curt Hibbs' new blog":http://bloglines.com/blog/CurtHibbs.  Curt is
  a kingly force in Rubydom who fires only cannons of pure action.  I talked to
  him once.  Yep, it's true.  I remember because I had to keep stopping myself
  from calling him "father."  It was really wierd.  He has a look in his eye that
  says, "I sired _all of you_."  It's cool.


  So, he started by blogging some justification for his outrageous claim that
  Rails is 10x quick.  And then, he blogged to debunk 37DHH's outrageous claim
  that Mac is teh rulez.


  Yeah, well, I gotta outrageous claim.  "I am 10x the ONLY way a guy should ever
  look
  like.":http://www.paulduncan.org/gallery/200211-rubyconf/640x480/dscf0180.jpg
