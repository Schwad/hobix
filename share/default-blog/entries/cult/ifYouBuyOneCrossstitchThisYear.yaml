  Twelve dollar kit from "The Red Hat
  Society":http://www.redhatsocietystore.com/shopexd.asp?id=716.  An unbelievable
  array of unintentional pun crossover for fans of
  "ruby-1.8.2-28.i386.rpm":http://www.caliban.org/files/redhat/RPMS/i386/ruby-1.8.2-28.i386.rpm
  who frost their hair. 


  Naturally, the kit's default slogan -- "Ruby Relaxes" -- could be replaced.  Try
  "Ruby Cracks My Back" or "After an Evening of REXML, I Am Putty in the Palm of
  My Sturdy, Red Easychair."  Also see: "I Shall Wear Purple and
