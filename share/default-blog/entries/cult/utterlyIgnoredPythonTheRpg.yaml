  This completely ridiculous "Python: The
  RPG":http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2001-February/031304.html was
  pitched on to comp.lang.python four years ago.  And the best part is: it availed
  no response from the crowd.

    Christian Tismer

      Advantages:

        * Can accomplish the impossible by changing the meaning of truth.
          Mystic ability influencing the fabric of reality.

        * Inspired Koreans. Christian can inspire hundreds of Koreans to
          the Pythonic cause. This should come in handy for something.
