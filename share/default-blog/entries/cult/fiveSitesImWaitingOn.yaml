  Here are the top 5 community sites that I've been refreshing for a month or
  longer, hoping for signs of life, listed in descending order of anticipation:


  # "codepaste.org":http://codepaste.org

  # "rcrchive.net":http://rcrchive.net

  # "rubygarden.org":http://rubygarden.org

  # "ruby-talk.org":http://ruby-talk.org (what will happen there when it's out of
  maintenance?)

  # "poignantguide.net":http://poignantguide.net


  The "Ruby Weekly News":http://rubygarden.org/rurl/html/index.html page would be
  up here if I hadn't noticed that Tim Sutherland is managing RWN with "weekly
  Wiki  pages":http://rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyNews/2004-12-13.  Great work, Tim. 
  It's good to see RWN back.

  Heck yes.  Within hours of this post, three of the above sites showed
  signs of being slightly fiddled with.  I can't tell you the rush of power I feel
  after blanketing the community with one of RedHanded's patented GuiltTrips (TM).
  

  Now, people.  Where are those "RDoc templates":/cult/rdocWithoutFramesAConcept.html 
  I ordered?  If I hear you shipped those UPS Ground, I'm going to blow my top.
