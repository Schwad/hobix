  bq. I was reading Beth Skwarecki's blog, casually perusing some pictures she
  posted from her latest FSF meeting, when I noticed something interesting. Take a
  look at "this
  picture":http://loxosceles.org/photos/2005-03-26_fsf_meeting/img_2480-small.jpg.
  Left side of the picture, on the blackboard, next to the word "Firefox". See
  anything familiar?


  It looks like its place on the blackboard was previously held by
  "iPod":http://loxosceles.org/photos/2005-03-26_fsf_meeting/img_2444-small.jpg. 
  I suspect this is the work of a group called the Pre-Eventualists, who make
  their work replacing crucial components of algebraic notation and architectural
  blueprints with short phrases that often evoke a sobering social indictment. 
  I'm not beyond speculating that Fox Tall and Fox Small have escaped and are at
  large.  (From "Dan's blog":http://www.livejournal.com/users/djberg96/.)
