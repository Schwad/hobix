  Steamin right along.  Rails, that is.  The final logo has been unveiled with the
  launch of the new central  "Rails website":http://www.rubyonrails.com/.  I'd say
  it turned out pretty well for the thousand bucks.  If any of you have tried to
  work Ruby into a logo, you can probably appreciate the way the facets are
  expressed.  And, as far as frameworks go, is there anything competitive out
  there?


  Looks like the news from the old Wiki has been moved into a new
  "weblog":http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/.
