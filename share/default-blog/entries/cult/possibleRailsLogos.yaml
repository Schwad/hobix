  "Hicks Design":http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/portfolio/, the design firm behind
  the brilliant Firefox and Thunderbird logos, has been entrusted with designing
  the new logo for Rails.  All made possible by a "community
  fundraiser":http://rubyonrails.org/show/RailsVisualIdentity that quickly ended
  when the "PragProgs":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000289.html swoopt down and
  doubled all contributions.


  Well, the design has been through two rounds of sketching and subsequent
  commentary on the Rails wiki.  Looks like things are coming along.

  The first round of mockups can be found
  "here":http://www.loudthinking.com/share/RubyRails.pdf.  Second round is
  "here":http://www.loudthinking.com/share/RubyRails2.pdf.  This sort of thing
  should be done for Ruby Central, Inc. and probably for Ruby itself.
