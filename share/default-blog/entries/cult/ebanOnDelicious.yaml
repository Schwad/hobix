  I'm shocked and honoured and, frankly, thrilled to see what will be showing up
  in "eban's del.icio.us account":http://del.icio.us/eban/, which appeared
  yesterday. Best known for being "Just another Ruby
  porter":http://jarp.jin.gr.jp/diary/, eban has compiled Ruby on likely hundreds
  of platforms and has also "kept time":http://cia.navi.cx/stats/author/eban for
  Ruby-Core, faithfully altering @version.h@ nightly for nearly five years.


  Some of his links are in English, others in Japanese.  Which is excellent on
  both counts, because we can get an idea of eban's thoughts the best of English
  development, and we can also get a window into great Japanese links.  I've
  already come away with "C Cod":http://ccod.sourceforge.net/ and
  "Check":http://check.sourceforge.net/.  I've been using
  "CuTest":http://cutest.sourceforge.net/ for its simplicity, but I'm open to
  something new.
