  |Two or three times each year, Macintosh enthusiasts go nuts over Apple's new
  product launches, and the company rides a wave of publicity from the resulting
  media attention. Open source projects would do well to study how Apple
  orchestrates this, because publicity is the key to attracting new users -- and
  new users are the lifeblood of the development model.|


  bq. Aha! I hadn't thought of that. (Therefore, it is not good.)



  bq. So, how about the release of Ruby 1.8.4 on OSCON?



  bq. The problem is PR. Ruby 1.8 line is in stable term completely, thus it seems
  to me that nobel features won't be included. To attract, I have no choice but to
  release the one has more features, in a word, Ruby 1.9 line.



  bq. It might be not glad from a developer's viewpoint.
