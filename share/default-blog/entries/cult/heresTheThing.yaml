  Well, RedHanded was a month old.. err, a couple days ago.  It's just kinda
  wierd.  Because I thought I'd run out of stuff.  Nope, turns out there's no end
  to the worldwide mayhem that Ruby has caused.


  Anyway, thankyous are in order.  I can sense from your comments and e-mail that
  you're having fun following, so let's push things forward.


  There's just one thing you can do for me this year -- and I think it will pay
  off for you as well -- come to OSCON.  Come
  "speak":http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/ if you want.  If my ridiculous and
  totally inappropriate session submission gets accepted, then I will join the
  besiegement.  And so, yeah, I'd really like to see you folks come along.
