  The bulk of the codeslinging is over at "TheServerSide's Bla-Bla
  announcement":http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=32723, so
  go there for your daily dose of wait-upwards-of-two-hours-for-a-rebuttal.  And
  to think that the late-breaking machismo showcase _revolves around checklists_.


  I went to Ta-da and made a list of "my favorite
  beverages":http://why.tadalist.com/lists/public/35933.  I couldn't believe it. 
  They're all perfectly in order.  I was so astounded that I shoke with joy,
  perspired, and squeezed a miniature melon from my navel.  (It even had a cute,
  little umbilical cord that I got to break off and use like a curly straw!)


  But wait!  See my list of "movies I need to watch with alternate
  soundtracks":http://blablalist.com/list/_why_/movies_alternate_soundtracks is
  all lined up and ready.  What a lovely and quite sobering surprise that Java can
  do sequential ordering as well.  I thought J2EE just converted Java code into an
  Electrical Engineering degree.  One-to-one.  Like that.  Ah, no, get informed. 
  Java does a lot of the same stuff that other to-do platforms can do.


  *In fact, I hear that Java is 10x more stable.*  So when people are mobbing the
  to-do list's servers, madly scrambling to get in, clawing at the screen to get
  their stuff checked off, Java won't go down.


  How crappy would that be if you had one last item on your list ("make a hot
  fudge sundae using only REAL breast milk") and you finally got it done (you
  actually made a hot fudge sundae using only REAL breast milk) and you _couldn't
  get in to the servers to check it off_?


  You did it.  You went and accomplished something amazing!!  And your to-do list
  is buried in some corrupted MyISAM table under a stack of seized dispatch.cgi
  processes.


  CGI.  Heh.  No way.  Java has redundant servers.
