  I am making you guys cool!  Except all today's music is dorky.  For computer
  nerds.  Bummer.


  h2. Kid606 "Catstep / My Kitten / Catnip-Vatst"


  Okay, so, hyperactive raver nerds.  Hopping on the keyboards with pacifiers and
  bracelets and all that.  And this is the computer singing astride that cat
  crawling back behind the monitor.


  I just like where the computer goes to sing up high and it goes _zhi-i-yipp_!


  h2. Ratatat "Desert Eagle"


  And these are the nerds who are still playing Contra on emulators or watching
  episodes of _Arena_, wherein Jim Kirk and the Gorn return to animalian instincts
  and brute manual fistclubbing.


  It's the music on Atari when California Games starts and a rainbow test pattern
  shows up behind the palm trees.
