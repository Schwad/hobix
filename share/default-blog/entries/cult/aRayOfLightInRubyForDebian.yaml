  We're all so protective over our little jewel.  We've got it in a
  climate-controlled room, nesting in a weave of white lasers, inches from the
  nostril fumes of invisible ninjas, tons of black magic is present, the Spy
  Hunter (TM) car is waiting over in the back of the unmarked van getting a refuel
  -- and then Debian brought down the guillotine, huh?


  The debacle is: Ruby has been cut up into
  "34ths":http://www.jamisbuck.org/jamis/blog.cgi/programming/34%20Reasons%20Why%20I%20Will%20Never%20Use%20Debian_20050125144114.tx
  by the Debian team.  Paul van Tilburg has "raised his
  hand":http://paul.luon.net/journal/debian/RubyStdlib.html to answer for Ruby on
  Debian.  I act as the omnipresent and omniscience force that can say and do
  anything with no repercussions.  (I've been drinking grape soda.)


  I can't say I always know what's best for Debian.  Daigo, help us out?  The
  @ruby-stdlib@
  "suggestion":http://lists.debian.org/debian-ruby/2004/08/msg00000.html seems
  about right.
