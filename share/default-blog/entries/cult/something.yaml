  "Ruby":http://jimweirich.tadalist.com/lists/public/14055 is the mandolin
  minstrel. 
  "Python":http://blog.ianbicking.org/fixes-whats-wrong-with-python.html is the
  slide trombone quartet.  And
  "Smalltalk":http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/userblogs/avi/blogView?showComments=true&entry=3284695382
  is the Turtle Intramural Choir.


  I wish we had more to offer people than lists.  If only they had a coupon so
  they could go right to the gypsy camps and hear the show for themselves.
