  (Eye shake, cartoon duck honk.)  So he's stepped up from wanting a language for
  "his kids":/cult/isRubyTheLanguageForDonBoxSKids.html to wanting it for
  Microsoft at large.  While speaking at the Competitive Influentials conference,
  Don Box is "paraphrased
  as":http://raibledesigns.com/page/rd/20050317#microsoft_day_1_afternoon:  _if he
  could change one thing at MSFT, it would be that Ruby would become the language
  of choice._


  If I could change one thing about my pet spider Daniel, it would be that Ruby
  became his language of choice.  Check back a year from now and we'll see who's
  made more progress.


  Search around the conference link above for Ruby and you'll see hints of
  interest throughout the talks there.  (Thank _Gordon Hartley_ on Ruby-Talk.)
