  "Open Source Conference 2005":http://www.ospn.jp/osc2005/ was hold at Mar 25-26
  here in Tokyo. There were two sessions about Ruby at the following day. We kept
  uploading live JPEG snapshots to share the atmosphere. Sorry we could not say
  earlier (I didn't know Sasada-san had such a plan).


  About 100 people joined the sessions. Takahashi-san, Sasada-san, Stoyan and
  Kazuhiko-san talked about Ruby on Rails, YARV and Hiki which is a Wiki clone
  written by Ruby. Matz also chatted with Skype call from his home and answered
  questions from the audience.
