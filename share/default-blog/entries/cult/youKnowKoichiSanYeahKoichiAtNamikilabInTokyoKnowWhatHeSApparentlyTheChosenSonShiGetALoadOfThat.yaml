  Huge, exciting news.  But stay calm.  Keep your vitamins in your pocket.  Try
  your hardest not to yank the ejection lever.  This is all hearsay from IRC.


  <pre>
    <vruz> matz: any news about Ruby 2.0 ? Rite ? whatever comes next ?
    <matz> vruz: I have talked with Koichi Sasada, and he agreed to merge
           his YARV in the current interpreter.
    <matz> I _hope_ VARV will be core engine before the end of this year.

  Matz called this coming leader by the name "son-shi":":/ruby-talk/76603.  I'd
  call him son-shi just for assembling the "instruction
  table":http://www.atdot.net/yarv/insnstbl.html.  This table comes from the
  bleeding-edge in "his svn":http://www.atdot.net/svn/yarv/trunk/.  I'm totally
  amazed at the diary he keeps on his progress.


  More on building YARV in "an earlier
  post":http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/buildingYarvOhOneOh.html.  (The
  instructions still work for 0.2.0.)


  <div class="update">


  *A note:* Daigo has been recommending that we use another word rather than
  "son-shi" when addressing Koichi (since the title has been used when referring
  to the terrorist cult leader "Shoukou
  ASAHARA":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoukou_Asahara.)  He recommends
  _tai-tyou_ or _mei-zin_ as possible nicer "good guy" subsitutes.  Cheers, Daigo!


  *Furthermore:* Matz "did
  identify":http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/yarv-devel/2004-October/000171.html the
  impending title of _son-shi_ to Sasada-san in October 2004.  In the postscript,
  he equates _son-shi_ with another Japanese word, but Mailman has the encoding
  messed up.
