  If, by now, you still haven't submitted a "codefest 
  proposal":http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/announce.html, then you are obviously
  just trying to make me mad.  I'm taking it personal and I promise I will never
  stop hating you.  (Mean is the new funny.)

  Do you think it's any coincidence that the new Mac mini has been announced for
  $499?  I'm not sure how you could justify purchase of a Mac mini with the grant
  money, but you'll still have a dollar left over for beverages!  I dare you,
  tricksy hobbits.


  Today, I'm suggesting %{font-size:large}a new set of RDoc templates% be written
  for a codefest.  Sure, it's been suggested "once
  before":/cult/rdocWithoutFramesAConcept.html and, two weeks later, it's still a
  totally brilliant idea.  Hey, but it's not really my idea, I've been hearing DHH
  And The Railsers squealing about it for a month or so.


  John Long etched out a "fledgling
  JavaScript":http://johnwlong.com/downloads/rubyred-rdoc-template-test-1.html to
  illustrate framelessness for us.  Point is: we need docs like PHP and Python
  have.  I'm not talking content.  We have the content.  But we need a nice
  appearance, simplicity, and user comments.


  Okay, now I've beaten the hammer once today.  You can go read the
  "iProduct":http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/images/iProduct.gif spoof at Gizmodo. 
  It's chee-e-eky.
