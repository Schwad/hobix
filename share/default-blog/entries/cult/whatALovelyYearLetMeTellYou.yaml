  Coming off of the most shudderingly epochal year in Ruby's history, don't you
  feel like vital frameworks are simply too commonplace, that dazzling code is
  just too mainstream, that pragmatism is sorely tried, that all the ideals of
  modern man have been bumped up and hit the ceiling?  (Our previous ideals having
  been: to have ideals.)


  Of course you don't feel that way.  But, hey, let's at least face the fact that
  we've innovated the hell out of the basics.  Which is natural.  For example,
  this world has not yet finished with the burrito.  Personally, despite the
  thousands of burritos I've seen in my time, I'm just now happening upon my
  greater love for sweetened pork.


  By which I mean to say: welcome to those of you who are new to Ruby.  You are
  late, yes.  But your newness is right on time.


  Now, predictions for 2005:


  * *Dave Thomas* will disappear completely.  Loyal followers will mount a
  search-and-rescue, scouring the temples of Nepal and the villages of the
  Peruvian Amazon.  He will be found at the top of Mount Fuji, issuing actual
  karate chops to those who fail to solve code katas.  (On a related note, DHH is
  getting back into "sabre fencing":http://www.43things.com/things/view/5763, be
  wise.)

  * *David Alan Black* will just "happen" to post Ruby-Talk's 150,000th message. 
  Everyone will celebrate by continuing on to read the next message on the list.

  * People will spend so much time playing with *43things* (i.e. interfacing with
  the API, ranting about the coolness of the big-font-little-font emphasis, etc.)
  that no one will actually get anything on their lists done.  The world will
  become a debase and fetid place to be.  (However, those who vowed to "organize
  their mp3 collection":http://www.43things.com/things/view/2138 will have
  accomplished this much.)

  * *RedHanded*, hoping to expand its readership, will widen its topic to anything
  related to the color red.  Encouraging Ruby followers to perpetuate redness in
  their attire and blush, RubyConf will look something like a Target commercial,
  but without all that annoying white.


  Please note:  If you can't tell, the same facetious and gregarious Why you knew
  in 2004 will remain on the cloak-and-dagger.
