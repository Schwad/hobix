  Remember that scrappy "Ruby.org mockup":/cult/rubyorgMockup.html from a month
  back??  Well, things have been steadily moving on a redesign of
  "Ruby-Lang":http://www.ruby-lang.org/, thanks to the persistent efforts of Curt
  Hibbs, Ben Giddings, and a wealth of folks from ruby-talk.


  Matz gave his saintly blessings to organize a Visual Identity Team  and our
  friends who manage Ruby-Lang have joined the team to help guide us.


  As of today, Ben Giddings, John Long, Michel Martens and myself act as the core
  team and we will be presenting some designs in a week or two.  We already have
  some great designs in the works and I can't wait to slide them out under your
  noses!


  The daily public discussion and announcements can be followed on the
  "vit-discuss":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/vit-discuss list.
