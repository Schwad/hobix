  I'm not going to avoid getting cosmic today.  Because if part of coding in Ruby
  involved chanting together, all of us crosst the world, just when dawn is
  breaking in Japan, we'd all be chanting.  Thanks to that ghostly yanking on your
  sleeve that brought you here in the first place, that seductive finger made of
  perfume mist that went in one nostril and stayed put right in your cerebral
  cortex.


  Derek Sivers announces his plans to recode "CD Baby in Ruby +
  PostgreSQL":http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6286 and he justifies it by citing
  karmic will in a way that severely puts the mark on my own smittenness:


  bq. Like a lost soul walkin' the earth, lookin' for spirituality, that stumbles
  upon the right church with the right people at the right time, I've found my
  niche with Ruby. Its little itty-bitty community attracts some brilliant "think
  different" types with a love for beautiful code that do this for love, not
  money.
