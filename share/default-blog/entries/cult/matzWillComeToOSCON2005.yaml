  bq. "O'Reilly Open Source Convention":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/
  will be held on August 1-5, 2005 - Oregon Convention Center Portland, Oregon. 
  There is a Ruby track in this year (it was held in year before last but not in
  last year). Because the due date for proposals I was commissioned by
  RubyCentral's friends is Midnight (PST) February 13, 2005, I submitted it in a
  mad rush.


  bq. The theme is "Yield to the Block: the Power of Blocks in Ruby". I will talk
  about the various uses of Ruby's Block. I'm worry about that I could hold out.
  In Japanese, I am confident about doing it, but not in English.


  bq. I am supposed receive a result March 7, 2005. In case that the acceptance
  comes, I'll go, but I must make shift the travel fees. Because I want to go Ruby
  Conference in Fall, I must find a sponsor. It made things easier in last year,
  because I didn't go overseas.


  bq. If anyone be able to entry as presenters, he has free registration instead
  of a little expensive registration. If you do it at all, I advise you to try it
  because you have nothing to lose and it's said that there's little competition
  for the Ruby track.
