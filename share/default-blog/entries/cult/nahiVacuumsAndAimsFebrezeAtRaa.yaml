  Trimming the stale crusts from the Ruby Application Archive has yielded a
  "master list":http://raa.ruby-lang.org/announce20050320.html of 213 projects
  which spurted 404 when their URLs were queried thrice -- on the 4th, 14th, and
  19th of this month.  NaHi removed these libraries.  This amounts to about a
  sixth of the total archive.


  I eyeballed the list and saw quite a few libraries which we should get repaired
  pronto:


  * FastCGI, FCGI, and any other variants are gone.

  * libxml, libxslt are gone.  (I know these libraries are out-of-date, but the
  source could be handy to keep links to.)

  * MiniRubyWiki.  (Broken because RubyForge's viewcvs path changed.)

  * tar (Jamis), minitar (Austin) both gone.

  * ruby-qt, ruby-kde, and a few ruby-gtk* packages.


  You get the picture.  Go scan for yours.  I have the opposite problem.  Some of
  my libs I haven't got around to putting in RAA yet.  Blast that.
