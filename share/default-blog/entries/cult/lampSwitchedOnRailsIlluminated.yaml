  Got some mails from you folks wanting to report "the feature
  story":http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html at O'Reilly's
  ONLamp.com, a whopping five-page intro to setting up a Rails environment on
  Windows.  Written by Curt Hibbs, who maintains the Windows Installer, WxWindows
  bindings and his half of FreeRIDE. 


  This is an awesome article.  Thick and juicy with screenshots and not a dull
  moment.  Each page sensibly cruises through Ruby, then through a few database
  tables, then fleshing out a simple cookbook application.  This is definitely a
  hot link, pass this *ON*.  Curt, we're proud of you, well done.


  We should offer a translation for OS X.


  I totally adore the little graphic they gave Rails.  _Mama, we got the loot. 
  Let's gid outta here!  Choo-choo!_

  Someone call Natalie Portman, I have hot grits in my pants.
