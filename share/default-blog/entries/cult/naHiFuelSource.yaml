  Is "this":http://www.jin.gr.jp/~nahi/d.cgi?cmd=view;name=jun really a food photo
  blog by NaHi?? Now we can get actual shots of the very substances that are
  powering SOAP4R's creation!!  I'm not sure what that is to the left, but it was
  presumably eaten yesterday.  My guess would be: a ramen calzone.


  NaHi actually has a rather large bite, when put to scale against a keyboard.


  <div class="update">


  *StandardError:* It turns out, this isn't NaHi's food blog.  It's his
  sister-in-law's.  Still, I insist, this story is relevant!  I still want to know
  what NaHi's eating that's giving him his sudden bursts of stamina.
