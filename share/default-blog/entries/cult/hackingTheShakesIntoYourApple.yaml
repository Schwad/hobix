  Within the past week, a couple fellows around the web have started scripting the
  accelerometer couched in Apple PowerBook hard drives, giving the effect of a
  three-dimensional motion sensor.  The
  "amstracker":http://www.kernelthread.com/software/ams/ commandline is really all
  you need to get started, as evidenced by "this Python
  script":http://interconnected.org/home/more/2005/03/bumptunes.py, which controls
  iTunes by either "bumping" the laptop to advance a track or by rocking the
  laptop to move around the playlist.


  Joey DeVilla has further *challenged* the scripting world to "turn the PowerBook
  into an
  Etch-A-Sketch":http://farm.tucows.com/blog/_archives/2005/3/8/409019.html.  So
  you can reboot your laptop by evoking the familiar Flip-N-Pull-A-Seizure manual
  restart of the kiddie canvas.


  Soon, coding will be an elaborate game of Bop-It!
