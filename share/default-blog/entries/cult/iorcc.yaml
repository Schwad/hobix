  The obfuscated code in the advert is a "tiny ETA
  interpreter":http://www.stephensykes.com/tinyeta.html wizarded by Stephen Sykes
  in 2004 -- it took him two years to refactor off the last 81 bytes!


  Here's the code nicely printed:


  <pre>
   i=*$<;_=a=$==-1;i[_].scan(/\w/){!p='htaoinse'=~$&or
   a<0?i<<eval(%w^,>0?i.slice!(a-p):i[p+a] ,,==0||(_=c-2;break), _+2
   ,utc(p), getc||a a=0, ,,-c ,,;i<<p/c;p%c^[p].gsub',',';c,p=p,i.pop
   p'):a=p>6?i<<a&&~0:a*7+p}until(_+=1)/$.!=0
  </pre>


  Look for the ensuing flamewar over the wrongness of this all on ruby-talk. 
  Obfuscation still pops up as a controversy.  If you let stuff like obfuscated
  Ruby get under your bonnet, uh.. well.. why is it that you're wearing a bonnet
  again?? (whoops, via "~matz":http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/.)
