  Okay, great.  So we have five recipients of RubyCentral's codefest grant program
  (a contest featured in January's CashHanded "#1":/cult/cashHandedOne.html,
  "#2":/cult/cashHandedTwo.html, "#3":/cult/cashHandedThree.html,
  "#4":/cult/cashHandedFour.html and "#5":/cult/cashHandedFive.html.)  The five
  recipients will receive up to $500 in grant money, to be used towards hosting a
  gathering of Rubyists, all united in building libraries for Ruby.


  Here are the winners and their locations.  So, if you live in any of these
  areas, think about contacting the host listed below and offering your services. 
  (You won't get paid, so.)  If you're not sure how to contact them, go ahead and
  use the comments for this entry to express your willfulness.


  * *Dave Tiu* (Boston, MA): Displaytag, a port to Ruby/Rails of a popular
  Java/Struts library for displaying and interacting with HTML table
  presentations.

  * *Andrey Melnik* (Ukraine): Ruby/AGG and Ruby/View, a wrapper library for
  "AGG":http://antigrain.com, allowing users to draw high-quality graphics.  Later

  also based on AGG.
