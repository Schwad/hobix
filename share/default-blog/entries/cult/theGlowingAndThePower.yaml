  See, this is what's best, people.  Rosy and bejeweled trackballs from Japan. The
  model pictured to the left is the  "Logitech
  ST-45UPi":http://mineko.fc2web.com/box/tb-room/items/logitech-st-45upi.html and
  it absolutely reeks of Ruby Mastermind.


  I can guarantee that _son-shi_ ("the promised guru who will lead us out of
  bondage and  straight to the promised Rite":/ruby-talk/76603) is using this
  trackball right now.  However, it is certainly possible that _son-shi_ has
  inlayed the trackball into a gargoyle's hand.  He is allowed such modifications.

  Another beautiful specimen: "Microsoft Trackball 
  Explorer":http://mineko.fc2web.com/box/tb-room/items/microsoft-trackball-explorer.html.
  Oh, that lovely wasp's eye, laced with millions of sensors to detect each
  delicate pad of your finger.  Its love for you is deep.  (More trackballs at
