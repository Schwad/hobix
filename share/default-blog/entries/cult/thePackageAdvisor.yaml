  Have you seen this page on the RPA wiki?   "The Package
  Advisor":http://rpa-base.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.cgi?PackageAdvisor. Popular
  stable packages categorized, advantages described, flagged if packaged. I think
  this could be a nice starting point for a fledgling Rubyist.  Kinda like a
  buffet table: I come to pick out a web framework and, while browsing, I find a
  database connector and a lightweight markup.


  It would be great to have a page for each package where users can leave feedback
  and describe any problems with the installation.
