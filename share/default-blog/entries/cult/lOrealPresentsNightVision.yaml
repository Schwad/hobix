  There's something special about this homemade "night vision
  kit":http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/spacesciences/observingsky/observing1.htm
  from the Office of Naval Research.  I get excited when I look at this.  Excited
  to coat a pack of lightbulbs with nail polish.  And then to hit the road, armed
  with the techonology to look at the sky whenever and wherever I choose.


  Imagine your life under the watchfulness of Rubyish orbs.


  I'm going to work in a harmonica brace.  So I can strap on this mayhem and code
  out in the reeds and cattails.  Nothing impaired.
