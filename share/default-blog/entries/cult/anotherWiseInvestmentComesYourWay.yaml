  If you are an elderly couple who shares a passionate love for the Ruby language
  (and its messenger RedHanded-dot-Hobix-dot-com), you may consider getting this
  ornate translucent red hand for your receiving room.  I'm sure you have a doily
  and lace curtains to go with this.  Or, it could go on the cherry wood end table
  atop a silver platter, reflecting ominously at your guests, who sense the
  timeless message: _Ruby is reaching for us, ever reaching... Wait!  IS RUBY...
  RUBY IS DROWNING!_


  And for Halloween, you could put one of those flimsy disposable medical gloves
  on it. (seen on
