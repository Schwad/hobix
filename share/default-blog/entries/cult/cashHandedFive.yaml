  I know a lot of you are coming over from PHP.  Well, you know what you can do
  for us? You can take your AuthorizeNet, Verisign, Paypal scripts and port them. 
  Maybe a single lib which could handle them all?


  Like
  "Business-OnlinePayment":http://search.cpan.org/~jasonk/Business-OnlinePayment-2.01/OnlinePayment.pm.
  With Rails people showing up, this could come in really handy.

  *Side Effects!*  I guess this series of articles is paying off.  I volunteered
  Wm Morgan for CashHanded #2.  "He's
  agreed.":http://www.all-thing.net/Ruby/ruby_codefest.html To this degree:


  bq. Well sure, fellow Rubyists, come on over to my place! I have air mattresses,
  couches, and plenty computers to go around.


  bq. Just be warned that every moment I'm not at work or sleeping is basically 
  spent in Emacs, in my undies, martini in one hand and Cuban cigar in the other.
  It's tha Rubyist lifestyle.


  *Also*, CashHanded #1 suggested a spam-filtering library.  If your interest was
  _piqued_, look at other ideas "here":http://del.icio.us/tag/spam, including the
  "MovableType-SpamAssassin
  plugin":http://www.kahunaburger.com/blog/archives/000189.html. How will our glue
  look?
