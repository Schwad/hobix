  "Advogato":http://advogato.org/ is a joint journaling site for developers.  Its
  three primary features:


  # Members use a simple ranking system to reward each other.  This provides a
  good outlet for admiration of "other":http://advogato.org/person/cce/
  "volunteers":http://advogato.org/person/ged/.

  # Diary entries are "filtered and 
  aggregated":http://advogato.org/recentlog.html?thresh=3 for you.  Since Advogato
  is a pretty low-key site, sitting slightly under the radar, it's got a good mix
  of developers across the entire free-o-sphere.

  # Apprentices and beyond have free reign to post articles directly to the front
  page.  While this leads to an upredictable quality in articles, it is a great
  way to get word out on a topic.  One article I posted -- "The Little Coder's
  Predicament":http://www.advogato.org/article/671.html -- was slashdotted and
  lambda'd the morning after it was posted.


  Best of all, Advogato is very simple.  It is the del.icio.us of social networks.
  However, once you've posted a diary entry and certified some folks, you're
  done.  It's not the sort of site you can spend all day wandering through.


  I've found a "handful of Ruby
  people":http://advogato.org/person/whytheluckystiff/diary.html?start=51 around
  Advogato.  If you join up, give a comment herein and we'll get you certified. 
  It's good to talk about Ruby in such a place.  I found YAML in someone's diary
  at Advogato and look what happened. I'm just sayin.
