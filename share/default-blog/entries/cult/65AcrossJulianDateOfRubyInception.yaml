  Another indication of how much lore and trivia surrounds our Little Red Culture,
  let us now visit Todd Nathan's "supplemental crossword
  puzzle":http://iorcc.dyndns.org/2005/puzzles/crossword/ for this year's
  obfuscation contest.


  A few favorite clues:


  * 13 Down. In a class by itself

  * 9 Down. Spoken with twist, and influential

  * 33 Across. Host language laboratory

  * 75 Down. Slippered girl's canine


  And 25 Across is for all o' you.  Nicely done, Todd.  I'm gonna print this out
  and do it with my grandma later.
