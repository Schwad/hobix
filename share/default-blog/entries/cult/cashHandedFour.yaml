  People love codefests.  Many things change over time, but a few things are
  always the same.  People _have_ always and _will_ always love codefests.  In
  fact, everyone does.  But, in particular, you love codefests.  It is a basic
  human need.  


  Scientists estimate that a human being can only survive for about four hours
  without codefests.  But I probably shouldn't mention such deprivation.  My point
  isn't to be gorey.


  Two of my colleagues have mentioned building a %{font-size:large}bug tracker
  application in Rails%.

   At first, I thought, "No."  It seemed too great an endeavor for a codefest.


  But I started thinking about it and perhaps, just by tying together a number of
  elements, you finish a Trac clone.  It would require a decent team: an
  individual who knows Instiki or Ruwiki internals, a Railser who can assemble the
  ticketing system, and an HTTP magician who can start by simply wrapping the
  Subversion web access.


  Yeah, it's possible.
