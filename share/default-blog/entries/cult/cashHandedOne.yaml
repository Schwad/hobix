  Each day this week I'm going to be pitching some ideas for  "Ruby
  codefests":http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/announce.html.  You have twenty days
  from today to get your act together and pitch the idea.  Free money =
  CashHanded.


  Before I get into today's idea, let's dispell a few myths.


  # *You need a team in order to submit.*  No, I'm sorry, you don't need a team
  yet. Submit your idea now.  Qualify for the grant.  After that, work on
  assembling your crew.

  # *Your has idea must be amazing.*  Uh, we need libs.  Badly.  I mean, sure, we
  want to see a good lib come out of codefests.  But it can be a rewrite. In fact,
  in rewriting a CPAN module or a Python lib, you might discover an unpaved Ruby
  way and inadvertantly revolutionize.  You tripped and changed everything.

  # *You can wait and submit later.*  Okay, well, you might be able to.  But
  submit now and give us time to think about your idea and it'll have a higher
  chance of winning simply because we'll have considered it more.


  So, you have up to $500 to use in building a library.  Today's example is a
  generic bayesian filtering library.  RedFolk could use this.  Something that
  could be plugged into gurgitate-mail and also into Rails blogs and wikis.  Its
  API would allow you to query its word lists.  You could pipe in RSS feeds and
  let it determine which articles you'd be more likely to read.


  In this example, we'll assume you're going to build the library with a few
  locals.  One of you works at a company and you've spoken to your boss,
  determined that it could be in your company's interest to host it at the office.
  You even decide to advertise it a bit: flyers at a nearby university, a post to
  Ruby-Talk, you notify a few local blogs or LUG sites.


  Now, remember.  You can't use the grant money to pay participants.  And you
  won't be travelling significantly.  But you could likely justify use of the
  money for your advertising costs. You might be able to justify acquistion of a
  central hard drive for development, since your company might not want you
  developing on their machines.  And I would highly recommend renting a nice
  projector for going through the plan together and for _The Matrix Revolutions_.


  Soup up your codefest.  That's what the moula is for.
