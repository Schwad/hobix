  I'm sorry, I'm just bewildered.  And quite sympathetic.  Perhaps you'll see what
  I see in Brian McCallister's
  "explanation":http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/2005/03/08/#containers-and-webapps
  of containers in webapps.  He's clearly speaking to Java developers.  But using
  Ruby and YAML to describe his thoughts!


  We don't want to call Ruby a scripting language, right?  A phrase laden with
  futility.  And _agile language_ is just a peppier replacement.  For once,
  friends, I beg of you: take me seriously.


  Coderspeak is the word you want.  From _Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby_:


  bq. My conscience won’t let me call Ruby a computer language. That would imply
  that the language works primarily on the computer’s terms. That the language
  is designed to accomodate the computer, first and foremost. That therefore, we,
  the coders, are foreigners, seeking citizenship in the computer’s locale.
  It’s the computer’s language and we are translators for the world.


  bq. But what do you call the language when your brain begins to think in that
  language? When you start to use the language’s own words and colloquialisms to
  express yourself. Say, the computer can’t do that. How can it be the
  computer’s language? It is ours, we speak it natively!


  bq. We can no longer truthfully call it a computer language. It is _coderspeak_.
  It is the language of our thoughts.


  I truly hate to quote myself.  I feel bad about it already.  It's just.  This
  quote is so lucid, it's like someone else said it.  How's that?
