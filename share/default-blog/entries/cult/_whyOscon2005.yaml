  Just got confirmation that I have a slot at this year's
  "OSCON":http://conferences.oreilly.com in Portland, OR.  I will be performing a
  three-act tutorial laced with puppetry & synthesizers & coding.  Titled: "A
  Starry Afternoon, A Sinking Symphony, and The Polo Champ Who Gave It All Up For
  No Reason Whatsoever."


  bq. They say Ruby is like a fine ostrich skin glove.  When worn while coding,
  your hands are possessed with a cunning dance.  When the naysayers come beating
  at your door with disdain, the glove slaps them full force, leaving an
  intoxicating spearmint flavor on their chins.  If only you could take Ruby into
  the shower.


  bq. Now you can touch and feel Ruby in a real, live Ewoks on Ice environment! 
  It turns out that why the lucky stiff's 3-in-1 Ruby code fiesta is coming to
  OSCON.


  bq. A Starry Afternoon explores ideas behind teaching programming to adolescents
  and the eager.  A Sinking Symphony will give a heartfelt tour of Ruby's rich,
  evocative culture.  Finally, The Polo Champ Who Gave It All Up For No Reason
  Whatsoever will denounce the previous concepts and stampede the audience with
  code.  And despite the obnoxious puppetry and synthesizer music, you will find
  yourself walking away, uttering, "How did I learn       something?"


  bq. Please know, my friends: moustaches required.


  It also looks like David Hansson and Dave Thomas will be presenting "as
  well":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000416.html.  And, as previously reported,
  "Matz":http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/matzWillComeToOSCON2005.html also.  Can
  you imagine how this will play out??
