  Can we all relate to the yelps on Ruby-Talk for cleaner output from RDoc?  (For
  an example of an RDoc site, see "ActiveRecord":http://ar.rubyonrails.org/.) 
  More recently, RDoc has also offered a
  "four-pane":http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/ view.


  John W. Long offered a mockup he did for a  "Class-per-page
  layout":http://johnwlong.com/images/rubyred-rdoc-template.png which uses IFRAMEs
  to avoid cluttering, but allow the same navigation.  Though he hasn't had time
  to work them out completely, he's implemented the HTML and offered his work up
  for anyone to finish.


  <div class="update">


  *Update*: John's templates are
  "here":http://johnwlong.com/downloads/rubyred-rdoc-template.zip. Personally,
  something like this would be a killer idea for a
  "codefest":http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/announce.html.  John has also asked
  that we be sure to include a "copyright attribution.":/ruby-talk/124177 Thanks,
  John!


  *Update &#x2116; 2*: The templates do not use IFRAMEs.  Those are DIVs = better
  browser support. John has also indicated that the templates are copyright-free,
  so everybody can settle down.


  </div>
