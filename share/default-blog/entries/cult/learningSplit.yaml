  "Split-s":http://split-s.blogspot.com/, a nice blog for getting down some basic
  Ruby concepts.  The code here on RedHanded can be pretty heavy handed sometimes
  -- I'm completely out of touch with each of your pressing needs -- so I'll defer
  to split-s when it comes to topics such as "conditional
  initialization":http://split-s.blogspot.com/2005/01/conditional-initialization-in-ruby.html.
  Which culminates in an explanation of this snip:


  <pre>
   def addToList(key, value)
     (@map[key] ||= []) << value
   end
  </pre>


  Martin also codes in Java -- expect some comparisons.  If you lack know-how on
  duck typing, take a gander at yesterday's "Quack,
  Quack":http://split-s.blogspot.com/2005/02/quack-quack.html.
