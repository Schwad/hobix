  Does it trouble you -- "the rules of insider
  blogging":http://www.livejournal.com/users/zestyping/100925.html?  I predict
  irony for this LiveJournal post.  After being heavily linked, it will vanish
  into obscurity as punishment for having a timestamp.


  bq. In the blogger-oriented parts of the Web, recency is the universal
  quick-and-dirty substitute for relevance. BloggerWeb tools always sort
  information by recency; once items get old past a certain point, they are buried
  in heaps of older entries, condemned to the oblivion of
  too-many-clicks-to-find-it-again. Unless you read and respond fast enough, you
  risk trying to have a conversation with an empty room long after everyone else
  has left the party. I suspect that all this emphasis on the short term leads to
  an ignorance of the long-term past. The faster you add items to a blog, the
  faster each individual item expires. The more blogs you aggregate, the faster
  each individual item gets forgotten. The faster you dump information into your
  brain, the faster it falls out. Maybe spending so much time shoving in
  short-term items even starts to elbow out long-term memory after a while.


  I've been thinking about this all week.  I'd like to think we've got some good
  stuff here on RedHanded, but I wish it were organized better.  Ultimately, it's
  the same with Ruby-Talk.  What can I give you?


  Imagine a Ruby-Talk where we could tag and rank posts.  Do we really need a
  taxonomy, though?  Can we go simpler?  What is the duck typing of free tagging? 
  We've got to find that!


  I spend gads of time on LiveJournal.  (But primarily because I'm fascinated by
  the Encyclopedia Brown / Bugs Meany or the Neville Longbottom / Darth Vader of
