  Merged Ruby packages of Debian [Version:
  "1.8.2-3":http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/ruby1.8/news/1.html] has come to the
  testing release after some
  "discussions":http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/whyIUseDebianWithRuby.html [1].
  Many Ruby libraries are now included in libruby1.8, which ruby1.8 depends on. So
  you can install most Ruby environment (the interpreter and the most libraries)
  by sudo apt-get install ruby1.8. Most users will be happy with this single
  command!


  It makes it easier to install Ruby in Debian, however, the upstream -- original,
  standard -- Ruby are still separated into a few packages because of maintenance
  and so forth. If you need Tcl/Tk you need to install libtcltk-ruby1.8; if you
  need openssl you have to install libopenssl-ruby1.8 one by one. You can see the
  other packages "here":http://packages.qa.debian.org/r/ruby1.8.html.


  fn1. A new package like ruby1.8-bundle that contains all Ruby environment seems
  to be planned but is not available yet.
