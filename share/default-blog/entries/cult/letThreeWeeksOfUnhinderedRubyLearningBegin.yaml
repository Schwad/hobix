  If you're completely new to Ruby -- maybe you haven't even seen a single scrap
  of Ruby code, maybe you don't know what it is at all -- you are invited to join
  Al Abut on "his three-week blogging
  escapade":http://alabut.com/nonsense/2005/03/ruby-self-tutorial-day-1-of-21-getting.html
  to learn Ruby, which began yesterday and will go through April 9th.  But
  yesterday was just a summary, so you're okay to start today.  He's summarizing
  chapters of Mark Slagell's "Teach Yourself Ruby in 21
  Days":http://tinyurl.com/5fg4v.


  But, yeah.  Follow the "RSS":http://feeds.feedburner.com/nonsense for three
  weeks and you're passively reading the whole book.  A good deal.
