  Ruby is so blisteringly alive right now.  A year ago all our websites were
  dormant.  In fact, I was exchanging e-mail with a publisher last March and they
  were sort of egging me on to write books about stuff other than Ruby.  And,
  seriously, the rationale was: are you sure Ruby is going to be around when your
  book is done??  I heard +no+ confidence in sales of a Ruby book.


  Some life-giving spring is flowing down to our riverbeds and lilypads, folks. 
  Everything is lush and warm and awake.  And it all is just happening in a
  bewildering spontaneous animation.


  Stuff like: Tim Sutherland started up the Ruby Weekly News outta nowhere.  (How
  many months back was that Tim??)  And now he's syndicating the RWN in the form
  of an "official blog":http://rubyweeklynews.org/.  Slurp up the
  "Atom":http://rubyweeklynews.org/index.atom or
  "RSS":http://rubyweeklynews.org/index.xml and watch the full newsletter roll
  onto your porch each week.  And, furthermore, well done to "Paul van
  Tilburg":http://paul.luon.net/, who graciously donated the site to Tim!  The
  goodwill is relentless in these parts!
