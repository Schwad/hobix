  Time for a snaky Python link as a peace offering today.  Saw this on Matz' blog.


  This blows my mind.  Steve Howell, the original author of PyYaml and pioneer of
  slideshows in YAML, wanted to teach kids Python using a Logo-like language for
  moving a little robot icon around a grid.  He got in touch with some folks
  working at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia.  There, he spearheaded a
  team  of high school kids to create "Guido van
  Robot":http://gvr.sourceforge.net/screen_shots/.


  Inspiring.  This has got to happen more.
