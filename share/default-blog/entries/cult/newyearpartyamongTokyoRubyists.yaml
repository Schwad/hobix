  Last Saturday, Tokyo Rubyists held a new year party after a private seminar once
  a month where they read Ruby Hacking Guide[1].  Takahashi-san[2] hosted it
  and other 16 folks including Aoki-san, Sasada-san and Tanaka-san, gathered
  and talked each other for four hours at the cold, rainy night.


  They chatted about the renewal plan of www.ruby-lang.org, Ruby 1.9 and 2.0, why
  no girl came and so forth.


  I discussed with Takahashi-san what Ruby's design patterns will look like. I'd
  like to know whether they are different from Java/C++'s that are grouped by GoF
  into three categories; creational, structural and behavioral patterns. I think
  structure and behavior of Duck Typing might be quite different --  however, DI
  container approach in Ruby may work as well as Java because creation is similar.
  He recommended "The Design Patterns Smalltalk
  Companion":http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201184621/qid=1106057945/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/103-8313131-0523056?v=glance&s=books&n=507846.

  was written by Aoki-san, which describes Ruby interpreter programming (i.e. C
  not Ruby).


  fn2. Takahashi-san is the leader of "RubyNoKai":http://jp.rubyist.net/, which
  means the Association of Ruby, and also the editor of Rubyist Magazine of Japan.
