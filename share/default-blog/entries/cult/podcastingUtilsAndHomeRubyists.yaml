  Look, two podcasting utilities on Rubyforge already:
  "podcatcher":http://rubyforge.org/projects/podcatcher/ and
  "rpodder":http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/rpodder/rubyPodder/rubypodder?rev=1.1.1.1&cvsroot=rpodder&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup.
  This is a glad omen.  Both of these utilities watch feeds and pull down audio
  files.  This is the sort of program that is a good starting place for someone
  learning Ruby.  Interesting enough to captivate a teenager, challenging enough
  to make it compelling.


  This is _exactly_ the sort of thing that should be taught in high schools.  Give
  kids a list of podcast feeds (perhaps in OPML like @podcatcher@ does) and help
  them write a script to download those files and build a playlist.  It might even
  be useful for us to have a Ruby learning site that just has a few simple
  tutorials like that.


  So, if you're wondering what Ruby is for, here's a reason.  To take something
  off the Internet  and shape it to your own use.
