  Reader Skip Speedbike stopped by earlier today and I want to echo the concern he
  has for you TextMate users who can't relate to the current robot icon.  You
  know-- the one that's gently dismembered.  Dismembered in a way that only OS X
  can make cuddly.


  In case this is troubling to you, and maybe you don't want your clients seeing
  that icon, or you lack the caregiving skills to  nurse the little robot back to
  help, "here":http://macromates.com/wiki/pmwiki?n=Main.AlternativeIcons are
  alternate icons, including the soft gears picto'd above.

  The link on the wiki to "this 1970s robot
  sensation":http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/572903.stm who sold mashed
  potatoes in the UK is a nice segway, too.  Original commercial is 
  "here":/bacon/CadburySmashMartians.mpg.  A beautiful related ad  can be found
