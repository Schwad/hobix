  It's tragic that this sat in my inbox so long.  I love it when people send
  e-mail with funny image attachments.  Annotated screenshots or spin-off comics.

  Here's proof sent by one Anders Bengtsson that he finished his starmonkey
  project.  He adds:


  bq. I recommended the poignant guide to a few coworkers who were starting out on
  a project in ruby. Since they hadn't used ruby before they not only got to enjoy
  your writing, but also seemed to be learning things!


  bq. Their project may have been stalled by other priorities. But the starmonkey
  we built still watches over them every day. It even gave the room a weird
  apple-scent for a few days before the apple dried.
