  On Ruby-Talk, there's been some discussion about working on a simple, friendly
  Ruby portal for new users.  I think Ruby-Lang is pretty good actually (and has
  come a long way since -NaHi redesigned- _as seen in the comments, NaHi did not
  redesign, he simply announced_).


  Still, after Ben Giddings mentioned the plausibility of negotiating ownership of
  Ruby.org or Ruby.net, I couldn't let the idea go.  Something like this:


  p=. !/images/ruby-org-mockup.gif(Envisioned screenshot of Ruby.org)!


  Three things I like in this shot:


  # *Current sites are given preference.*  The links in the main body must all be
  active, current sites.  No old docs.  No old news.  The featured news would
  require maybe 2 or 3 updates a month.  This would be very simple.

  # *Rails is on the front page.*  Rails is a hot topic.  The front page needs to
  reflect the most interesting aspects of Ruby to visitors.

  # *Ruby in 5 minutes.*  It would be great if we could pool together a simple
  summary of Ruby.  A five-page, one-minute-per-page summary, similar to "YAML in
  Five Minutes":http://yaml.kwiki.org/index.cgi?YamlInFiveMinutes.  If someone
  reads a short article on Ruby, they may start wanting to read more.  ("I've read
  for five minutes, but I have some time, so why don't I just spend the evening
  learning about this language?")


  I think Ruby has plenty of libraries.  We could use more, but we have great
  libraries that a lot of communities don't have.  I think we could use *better
  docs*.  Something closer to PHP or Python.  This will happen, though.  We have
  the content in RDoc, it just has to be organized.


  We just need a web presence that is *kept current*.  Most Ruby sites age several
  months without update.


  I'd also love to *emphasize using Ruby with C*.  Ruby's C API is brilliant. 
  It's so fantasically elegant when compared to other scripting interfaces.  I
  think an extensions section would be really attractive as well.
