  It's all over the place, yeah.  And, yet, "all
  together":http://www.planetrubyonrails.org/.  You've got
  "Technoblog":http://tech.rufy.com/.  You've got
  "railz0r3d!!":http://www.mans.de/railz0r3d/  And "jlaine":http://jlaine.net/,
  which has this great article I missed on caching with Rails 0.9.4.1 and up.


  bq. Using _action caching_ means that the request will go through Action Pack so
  all the filters are processed before the page gets served. That way you can use
  authentication and other magic in your pages without having to give up the glory
  of caching.


  bq. The most granular way to do caching in Rails is _fragment caching_. It’s
  what the two higher-level caching schemes use internally. Using fragment caching
  is a gem when you have pages that have both highly dynamic and pretty static
  parts. The downside is that it’s a bit more work and you have to do it in
  templates.


  I mean what better way to get into this stuff than sliding "just enough
  code":http://jlaine.net/blog/30/more-rails-goodness within your vision. (via
  "del.icio.us":http://del.icio.us/tag/ruby.)
