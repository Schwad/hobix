  Incident to some inadequacies in Ruby/DL, problems which kept Jamis Buck's pure
  Ruby SQLite3 libs from happening, concerns were brought to Ruby-Core.  Despite a
  day or so of silence, this afternoon yielded word from Takaaki Tateishi, the
  author of Ruby/DL.


  He says: 


  bq. Now I'm developing Ruby/DL2 to replace Ruby/DL with it. It will support
  'long long' type and remove restictions on callback function. But I'm not sure
  when it will be available.


  The Rubyforge project for Ruby/DL2 is
  "here":http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-dl2/.


  Yes, Japan is far away and, yes, the language barrier can seem insurmountable. 
  Ruby-Core is the gateway and I've never had anything go unnoticed there.  Be
  patient.  For example, Akira reported a "Syck
  bug":http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-core/4052 last week.
  I've just now got a fix that will go in with my next set of patches.


  Bug reports are just as important as bug fixes.  No, wait.  Strike that.  Bug
  reports are definitely more important.
