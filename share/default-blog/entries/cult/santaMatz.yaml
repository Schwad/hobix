  Following a "recent
  article":http://www.khason.biz/blog/2004/12/why-microsoft-can-blow-off-with-c.html
  which corrolated a language's success with the facial hair of its designer,
  Matz offered this  spritely pic of his Christmas beard.  If your resolution is
  too high to make out the shot, then you're missing out on five metric tons of
  Awesome.


  You also might note that "Matz' blog":http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/ is all
  tricked out with Christmas trees and stuff.  See, the smartest man alive is
  still capable of appreciating little animated GIFs.
