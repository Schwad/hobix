  Forget Kapsules.  I mean Kapsules is neat and I don't regret posting about it--
  absolutely not-- how could I?  I uphold the original decision to do so.  But
  imagine my paleness, the powerfright, when I saw the "Ruby-EFL
  bindings":http://code-monkey.de/?ruby-efl.  My allegiance to enlightenment is
  truer.


  I've been compiling e17 from CVS weekly.  It's lookin sly.  If you want to give
  it a try, I'd highly suggest the "Unofficial DR17 docs":http://lude.net/edocs/.


  The Ruby-EFL bindings give you hooks into e's internals.  Meaning you can write
  little apps and widgets for e.  Over the next few weeks, I'm gonna drop some
  Ruby scripts I've been using with e16 and e17.
