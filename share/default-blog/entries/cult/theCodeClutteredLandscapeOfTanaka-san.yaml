  I can hardly see anything else right now.  My vision is so obscured by the works
  of Akira Tanaka, who is gradually becoming deified in my perspective.  Since
  revisiting "webapp":/bits/holyGreatCgiInHeaven.html and
  "amarshal":/inspect/serializingToRubyCode.html, I have been mining the "personal
  CVS repository":http://cvs.m17n.org/viewcvs/ruby/ of Tanaka-san and walking away
  each time with pomegranate juices freely flowing down my chin.  I've already
  ruined five sailor outfits that way.


  Simple scripts, such as *project-name*, which checks SourceForge and Savannah
  for name clash in your ideas for project name (as well as returning a Google
  count.)  His succinct *regen* library which creates RegExp from a BNF-like
  syntax.  In fact, both his *abnf* and *lr* libraries really show his fondness
  for grammars.  He's got some great lexers in there.


  Also, more expansive libraries like *htree* which lazily parses HTML, builds a
  sensible tree, and outputs XHTML or can convert to a REXML structure. And his
  rethinking of standard libs, such as *tzfile*, a timezone-centric library for
  storing timestamps. And we're all by now familiar with *open-uri* and *pp*. 


  Fantastic.  It's a whole countryside.
