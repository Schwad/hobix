  Oh, a sleeping drunkard
  Up in Central Park,
  And a lion-hunter
  In the jungle dark,
  And a Chinese dentist,
  And a British queen--
  All fit together
  In the same machine.
  Nice, nice, very nice;
  Nice, nice, very nice;
  Nice, nice, very nice--
  So many different people
  In the same device.
