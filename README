Hi, this is Hobix CVS.  I can't imagine inadvertantly pulling
a checkout on Hobix source code, but if you did: well, then,
Hobix is a weblahhging tool.  It comes with a command-line and
a buncha libraries.

If you want to read all about it, see http://hobix.com/ for the
full deal.

If you want to try Hobix out, I suggest using the online installer,
which can be activated by running:

  ruby -ropen-uri -e 'eval(open("http://go.hobix.com/").read)'

Or you can install the CVS version here by using:

  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  sudo ruby install.rb install

Goo* luc*! -- _why
