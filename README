Hi, this is Hobix SVN.  I can't imagine inadvertantly pulling
a checkout on Hobix source code, but if you did: well, then,
Hobix is a weblahhging tool.  It comes with a command-line and
a buncha libraries.

If you want to read all about it, see http://hobix.com/ for the
full deal.

If you want to try Hobix out, I suggest using the online installer,
which can be activated by running:

  ruby -ropen-uri -e 'eval(open("http://go.hobix.com/").read)'

Or you can install the CVS version here by using:

  sudo ruby setup.rb

Goo* luc*! -- _why

## Contributing notes from heathen Nick (I'm a heathen because I'm putting in docs in _why's readme)

* local_install_example is an example of a local installation
* setup.rb and install.rb are relics from old ways of setting up ruby before rubygems. Try to use the Gemfile to document development dependencies
* The gemspec is in the rakefile
* make-go.rb is a utility that creates the `hobix-install.yaml` that is relied on by `go/hobix-install.rb` to run
* `pkg` holds the generated rubygem. can probably ignore this
