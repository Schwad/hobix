But papa says everyone on the battlecruiser had brushed their teeth and was tucked in and their little Monkey-Brite Nightlights were bolted into the wall so they went peacefully.\n\n\
  Don\xE2\x80\x99t get sunk like they did. Enroll in \"tutorials\":http://sl33p3r.free.fr/hobix-tutorials/hobix-tutorials.html by Frederick Ros. He knows so many secrets, nobody here at Hobix Finishing School had a clue how much you could do.\n\n\
  I\xE2\x80\x99m telling you: the tutorial here is nothing in comparison. Robert Brook is, however, collecting \"tips\":http://robertbrook.com/hobix/tips.html. While Lyle takes pushpins and tacks up \"the choicest speciments\":http://del.icio.us/lyle/hobix.\n"
